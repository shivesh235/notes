## Hands On LLM

### Tokenization <a id="tokenization"></a>

Tokenization is a fundamental process in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). The sources emphasize that it is the crucial first step in enabling LLMs to understand and generate human-like language.

**What is Tokenization?**

Tokenization is the process of **breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called tokens**. These tokens can be words, subwords, characters, or even bytes. LLMs do not directly process text; instead, they operate on these numerical representations of tokens. A text prompt sent to an LLM is first processed by a tokenizer, which breaks it down into tokens. Similarly, the output of an LLM is a sequence of token IDs that need to be converted back into readable text using the tokenizer's decode method.

**How Tokenizers Prepare Input for LLMs:**

Before a prompt is fed into an LLM, it goes through a tokenizer that splits it into pieces. This process results in a series of integers called token IDs. Each token ID is a unique identifier for a specific token (which could be a character, word, or part of a word) and references a table within the tokenizer containing all the tokens it knows â€“ the **tokenizer's vocabulary**. The `input_ids` variable in the `transformers` library, for example, holds this list of token IDs that the model uses as its input.

**Tokenization Methods:**

The sources discuss several tokenization schemes:

*   **Word tokens:** This earlier approach split text into individual words, and was common with models like word2vec. However, it struggles with new, unseen words and can lead to a very large vocabulary with minimal differences between tokens (e.g., "apology," "apologize").
*   **Subword tokens:** This is the **most commonly used scheme** in modern LLMs. It breaks text into a combination of whole words and parts of words. This method offers a balance between vocabulary size and the ability to handle new words by breaking them down into smaller, known subword units. Examples of subword tokenization methods include **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** (used by GPT models), **WordPiece** (used by BERT), and **SentencePiece** (used by Flan-T5). These methods aim to optimize the set of tokens to efficiently represent a given text dataset.
*   **Character tokens:** This method breaks text down into individual characters. It can handle new words effectively but makes modeling more difficult as the model needs to learn to form words from individual characters. Subword tokenization often allows fitting more text within a Transformer model's limited context length compared to character tokens.
*   **Byte tokens:** This method breaks tokens down into the individual bytes representing Unicode characters, also called "tokenization-free encoding". It can be competitive, especially in multilingual scenarios. Some subword tokenizers also include bytes in their vocabulary as a fallback for characters they cannot otherwise represent (e.g., GPT-2, RoBERTa).

**Key Factors Influencing Tokenization:**

Three major factors dictate how a tokenizer breaks down text:

1.  **The tokenization method:** The underlying algorithm used to determine the tokens (e.g., BPE, WordPiece, SentencePiece).
2.  **Tokenizer design choices:** Parameters like **vocabulary size** (the number of tokens in the tokenizer's vocabulary) and **special tokens** (unique tokens with roles beyond representing text, such as `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, `<|endoftext|>`, `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`). The choice of vocabulary size and special tokens can significantly impact a model's performance on specific tasks or domains.
3.  **The training dataset:** The specific text data the tokenizer is trained on to establish its vocabulary. A tokenizer trained on English text will differ from one trained on code or multilingual data.

**Examples of Tokenizer Differences:**

The sources provide a detailed comparison of tokenizers from various LLMs (BERT, GPT-2, Flan-T5, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Galactica, Phi-3/Llama 2). This comparison highlights how different tokenizers handle aspects like:

*   **Capitalization:** Some tokenizers are cased (preserving capitalization, like BERT cased, GPT-2, GPT-4) while others are uncased (converting everything to lowercase, like BERT uncased).
*   **Whitespace:** Some tokenizers preserve whitespace characters as tokens (GPT-2), while others might have specific tokens for sequences of whitespace (GPT-4, StarCoder2, Galactica). This is particularly important for code generation models where indentation is significant.
*   **Special tokens:** Different models use different special tokens to indicate the beginning/end of text, padding, classification, masking, conversation turns, repository/file names (for code), citations (for scientific text), etc..
*   **Handling of different languages and characters:** Some tokenizers might replace emojis or characters from other languages with an unknown token (`[UNK]`, `<unk>`), while others might handle them more effectively. Code-focused models like StarCoder2 might tokenize digits individually to better represent numbers and mathematics.

**Tokenization and Embeddings:**

Tokenization is intrinsically linked to **embeddings**, which are the numerical vector representations of tokens. After a text is tokenized into token IDs, the LLM looks up the corresponding embedding vector for each token from its **embedding matrix**. This embedding matrix is part of the LLM and contains a vector for every token in the tokenizer's vocabulary. These embeddings serve as the initial input to the language model for processing. Language models can also generate **contextualized word embeddings**, where the representation of a word varies based on its surrounding words in a sentence.

**Importance of Tokenization:**

A well-designed tokenizer is crucial for an LLM's performance. The way text is broken down into tokens directly affects how the model processes and understands language. Tokenization choices can influence:

*   **Vocabulary size:** A smaller vocabulary can lead to more out-of-vocabulary words, while a very large vocabulary can increase model size and computational cost.
*   **Context length:** The number of tokens that can fit within a model's context window depends on how efficiently the text is tokenized.
*   **Model performance on specific tasks:** For example, a tokenizer that preserves whitespace is beneficial for code generation, and a tokenizer designed for scientific text might include special tokens for citations.
*   **The model's ability to handle different languages and domains:** A tokenizer trained on a diverse dataset will likely perform better across various types of text.

In summary, tokenization is a critical preprocessing step that transforms raw text into a format that LLMs can process. The choice of tokenization method, vocabulary size, special tokens, and the training data for the tokenizer significantly impacts the capabilities and performance of the resulting language model. Understanding tokenization is essential for comprehending the inner workings of LLMs and their applications.

### Definition <a id="definition"></a>

You're asking to discuss the definition of **splitting text into tokens** within the larger context of **tokenization**, as described in the sources.

At its core, **splitting text into tokens** is the initial and fundamental step in the broader process of tokenization. As the sources clearly state, **tokenization is the process of breaking down a sequence of text into smaller units called tokens**. This splitting can occur at different levels of granularity, resulting in tokens that are words, subwords (parts of words), characters, or even bytes.

**In the larger context of tokenization, simply splitting the text is only the first part of the process.** Tokenization also involves several other crucial aspects that prepare the text for processing by Large Language Models (LLMs):

*   **Determining the Method of Splitting:** The sources detail various methods for splitting text into tokens. The choice of method (word-based, subword-based like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece, character-based, or byte-based) significantly influences how the text is represented. Modern LLMs predominantly use subword tokenization.
*   **Vocabulary Creation:** After the initial split, the unique tokens from the training data are compiled into a **vocabulary**. This vocabulary is a crucial component of the tokenizer, as it defines the set of tokens the model can understand and generate. The size and composition of this vocabulary are important design choices.
*   **Assigning Token IDs:** Once the vocabulary is established, each unique token is assigned a numerical identifier, or **token ID**. LLMs operate on these numerical IDs rather than the raw text. The `input_ids` that are fed into an LLM are sequences of these token IDs.
*   **Handling Special Tokens:** Tokenization also involves the inclusion and processing of **special tokens**. These tokens serve specific purposes, such as indicating the beginning or end of a sequence (`<s>`, `<|endoftext|>`), separating different parts of the input (`[SEP]`), handling unknown words (`[UNK]`, `<unk>`), or denoting conversational turns (`<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`).
*   **Influencing Factors:** The way text is split into tokens is influenced by several factors, including the chosen **tokenization method**, the **tokenizer design parameters** (like vocabulary size and special tokens), and the **dataset** on which the tokenizer is trained. Different LLMs utilize tokenizers with varying characteristics tailored to their specific tasks and training data. For example, code-focused models might handle whitespace and programming keywords differently than models trained primarily on natural language.
*   **Reconstruction (Decoding):** Tokenization is a reversible process. After the LLM generates a sequence of token IDs as output, the **tokenizer's decode method** is used to translate these IDs back into human-readable text.

Therefore, while **splitting text into tokens** is the initial step in tokenization, the overall process encompasses the choice of splitting strategy, vocabulary creation, assignment of numerical representations, handling of special markers, and the ability to reconstruct the original text from the token IDs. All these elements are crucial for enabling LLMs to effectively process and generate language. The way text is split directly impacts the subsequent steps and ultimately affects the model's understanding and generation capabilities.

### Methods <a id="methods"></a>

The sources emphasize that **tokenization methods are a fundamental aspect of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process and understand text**. The choice of method significantly influences the vocabulary of the model and how input text is broken down into tokens, which are then converted into numerical embeddings for the LLM to process.

Here's a discussion of the tokenization methods mentioned in the sources, within the larger context of tokenization:

*   **Whitespace Splitting:** This is presented as an **early and basic method** where text is divided into tokens based on whitespace characters. While straightforward, it has limitations, particularly with languages lacking clear word boundaries and in capturing semantic meaning beyond individual words. The sources use it as a starting point to illustrate the need for more sophisticated techniques.

*   **Subword Tokenization:** The sources highlight that **subword tokenization is the most commonly used scheme in modern LLMs**. This approach aims to strike a balance between word-level and character-level tokenization. By breaking words into smaller, more frequent units (subwords), it offers several advantages:
    *   **Handling of Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words:** New or rare words can often be represented by combining known subword tokens.
    *   **More expressive vocabulary:** Subword units can represent morphological variations of words (e.g., "apolog," "izing," "etic") more efficiently than having separate tokens for each.
    *   **Better context within limited context length:** Subword tokens often allow for more text to fit within a model's context window compared to character tokens.

    The sources specifically mention three prominent subword tokenization methods:

    *   **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** This method is **widely used by GPT models**. BPE works by iteratively merging the most frequent pairs of characters or subwords in the training data until a desired vocabulary size is reached. The tokenization examples for GPT-2, GPT-4, Phi-3, and Llama 2 illustrate how BPE breaks down words into subword units and handles whitespace and special characters.

    *   **WordPiece:** This method is **used by BERT**. Similar to BPE, it learns subword units. However, instead of frequency, WordPiece typically chooses to merge units that maximize the likelihood of the training data after the merge. The tokenization examples for both uncased and cased versions of BERT show how WordPiece handles capitalization and splits words into subword tokens (indicated by `##`).

    *   **SentencePiece:** This method is used by models like **Flan-T5**. SentencePiece differs in that the input is treated as a raw sequence of Unicode characters. It can then learn segmentation rules to form tokens. SentencePiece can implement both BPE and unigram language models. The Flan-T5 tokenization example demonstrates its approach to handling text and special tokens.

*   **Character Tokens:** This method breaks down text into individual characters. While it can effectively handle new words, the sources note that it makes **modeling more difficult** because the model has to learn to form words from individual characters in addition to understanding the relationships between them. Subword tokenization is presented as a more advantageous approach for fitting more text within the Transformer model's context length compared to character tokens.

*   **Byte Tokens:** This method breaks down tokens into individual bytes representing Unicode characters, sometimes referred to as **"tokenization-free encoding"**. The sources mention models like CANINE and ByT5 that explore this approach, highlighting its potential competitiveness, especially in multilingual scenarios. It's also noted that some subword tokenizers include bytes in their vocabulary as a fallback for representing characters they can't otherwise encode.

In the larger context of tokenization, the choice of **method is a critical design decision** that influences the LLM's vocabulary, its ability to handle different types of text (including code and multiple languages), and ultimately its performance. Modern LLMs have largely moved beyond simple whitespace splitting to **subword tokenization methods like BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece** to achieve a more robust and efficient representation of language. The specific characteristics of each method lead to different tokenization behaviors, as illustrated by the comparison of tokenizers used by various models.

* [**Whitespace splitting**](#whitespace-splitting)
* [**Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**](#bpe)
* [**WordPiece**](#WordPiece)
* [**SentencePiece**](#SentencePiece)
* [**Tokenization-free encoding**](#Tokenization-free)

<a id="whitespace-splitting"></a> The sources discuss **whitespace splitting** primarily as the **most common initial method for tokenization** within the **bag-of-words** technique, which is presented as an early method in the history of Language AI. However, the sources also highlight its **disadvantages** compared to more advanced methods used in modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

Here's what the sources say about whitespace splitting in the larger context of tokenization methods:

*   **Definition and Function:** The sources explain that **whitespace splitting** involves breaking up sentences into **individual words (tokens) by splitting on whitespace** characters. This is illustrated with an example where two sentences are split into words based on the spaces between them [13, Figure 1-3].

*   **Historical Context:** Whitespace splitting is mentioned in the context of the **bag-of-words model**, which gained popularity around the 2000s. It was a foundational technique for representing unstructured text numerically.

*   **Disadvantages:** The sources point out that whitespace splitting has **disadvantages**. A key limitation mentioned is that **some languages, like Mandarin, do not have whitespaces around individual words**, making simple whitespace splitting ineffective for them.

*   **Comparison to Subword Tokenization:** The sources contrast whitespace splitting with **subword tokenization**, which is the **most commonly used tokenization scheme** for modern LLMs. Subword tokenization addresses some of the limitations of word-level tokenization (which often relies on initial whitespace splitting) such as the inability to handle new words and a large vocabulary with minimally different tokens (e.g., apology, apologize). Subword tokenization can break down new words into smaller, known units and create a more expressive vocabulary.

*   **Handling of Whitespace by Modern Tokenizers:** When discussing modern tokenizers like those used by GPT-2 and GPT-4, the sources show that they handle whitespace in more sophisticated ways than simple splitting. For example, the **GPT-2 tokenizer represents newline breaks** as tokens, and the **GPT-4 tokenizer has specific tokens for sequences of whitespace**, up to 83 consecutive spaces. This indicates that while initial splitting might occur, the final representation within the LLM often goes beyond simply treating each whitespace as a delimiter.

*   **Relevance for Code:** The sources also note the **significance of whitespace characters for models to understand or generate code**. Models that use single tokens to represent multiple consecutive whitespace characters (like GPT-4 and StarCoder2) are considered **more tuned to a Python code dataset**, as indentation is crucial in Python. Representing indentation with individual space tokens can make modeling more difficult.

In the larger context of tokenization **methods**, whitespace splitting is presented as a **basic and early approach**. While it serves as a straightforward way to initially segment text into word-like units, it has limitations, particularly with languages that don't use whitespace as a primary word separator and in capturing the nuances of whitespace in contexts like code. Modern LLMs predominantly use **subword tokenization methods** like BPE, WordPiece, and SentencePiece, which can handle text more effectively by considering subword units and often have more intricate ways of representing or handling whitespace based on the specific needs and training data of the model.

<a id="bpe"></a> The sources identify **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** as a **popular tokenization method**, particularly used by **GPT models**. It is presented as one of the major factors determining how a tokenizer breaks down an input prompt.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about BPE in the larger context of tokenization methods:

*   **Tokenization Method:** BPE is explicitly listed as one of the key **tokenization methods** chosen at the model design time. Other popular methods mentioned alongside it are WordPiece (used by BERT) and SentencePiece (used by Flan-T5). These methods are described as similar in their aim to **optimize an efficient set of tokens to represent a text dataset**, but they achieve this in different ways.

*   **Usage in Specific Models:** The sources clearly state that **GPT models widely use Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**. It is also mentioned that **GPT-2** uses BPE. Furthermore, **GPT-4** is also listed as using BPE, with a vocabulary size of over 100,000. **Phi-3** and **Llama 2** are mentioned together, but their specific tokenization method isn't detailed in the same way, although the tokenization output shown seems consistent with subword tokenization approaches like BPE.

*   **Comparison with Other Methods:** While the sources don't provide a detailed technical comparison of the algorithms, they position BPE as an alternative to WordPiece and SentencePiece. The choice of method is one of the **major tokenizer design decisions**.

*   **Vocabulary Optimization:** The general goal of BPE, like other methods, is to establish the **best vocabulary** it can use to represent a specific dataset efficiently. This involves selecting a set of tokens that can effectively encode the training data.

*   **Handling of Whitespace:** When examining the tokenized output of different models, the GPT-2 tokenizer shows that **newline breaks are represented as tokens**, and whitespace within words can lead to separate tokens (e.g., "CAP" "ITAL" "IZ" "ATION"). Similarly, the output for Phi-3 and Llama 2 shows spaces leading to the separation of "C" "AP" "IT" "AL" "IZ" "ATION". This suggests how BPE, as implemented in these models, handles or doesn't handle whitespace within and around words. In contrast, some other tokenizers, like StarCoder2, are noted for encoding lists of whitespaces as a single token, which is considered beneficial for code representation.

*   **Token Vocabulary:** The vocabulary size of BPE-based tokenizers can vary significantly, as seen with GPT-2 having a vocabulary size of 50,257 and GPT-4 having over 100,000. This vocabulary size is a key parameter in the tokenizer's design.

In the broader context of **tokenization methods**, **BPE stands out as a widely adopted subword tokenization technique**, particularly favored by the GPT family of models. It plays a crucial role in how these LLMs process and generate text by breaking down language into manageable and meaningful units. While sharing the goal of efficient text representation with other methods like WordPiece and SentencePiece, BPE has its own algorithmic approach and results in specific tokenization behaviors, such as its handling of whitespace and the composition of its vocabulary. The choice of BPE as the tokenization method is a significant design decision that impacts the overall capabilities and performance of the language model.

<a id="WordPiece"></a> The sources indicate that **WordPiece** is a **subword tokenization method**. This places it within the broader context of different **methods** for splitting text into tokens, which include word tokens, subword tokens, character tokens, and byte tokens.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about WordPiece within this larger context:

*   **Subword Tokenization:** WordPiece is explicitly mentioned as one of the popular **subword tokenization methods**, alongside Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and SentencePiece. Subword tokenization, as a category, is highlighted as the **most commonly used scheme** in modern Language AI. It addresses the limitations of word-level tokenization (handling of new words and large vocabularies with minor variations) by breaking down words into smaller units, including whole words and word pieces.

*   **BERT Usage:** The sources specifically state that the **BERT base model** (uncased), introduced in 2018, uses the **WordPiece tokenization method**. This provides a concrete example of a significant and influential language model that adopted WordPiece.

*   **Similarity to BPE:** The sources note that WordPiece is **similar to BPE** in that both methods aim to **optimize an efficient set of tokens to represent a text dataset**. However, they also point out that these methods **arrive at their optimal token sets in different ways**. Unfortunately, the specific difference in how WordPiece arrives at its token set compared to BPE is not detailed within these sources.

*   **Vocabulary Size:** For the BERT base model (uncased) using WordPiece, the source specifies a **vocabulary size of 30,522**. This illustrates a typical scale for the vocabulary of a model using subword tokenization.

*   **Special Tokens:** The BERT tokenizer (which uses WordPiece) includes specific **special tokens** like `[UNK]` (for unknown tokens), `[SEP]` (a separator for tasks involving two text sequences), and `[PAD]` (for padding sequences). The inclusion and purpose of these special tokens are an important aspect of the overall tokenization process, regardless of the specific splitting method.

In the larger context of tokenization **methods**, WordPiece represents a strategy to effectively balance vocabulary size and the ability to handle unseen words. By segmenting words into subword units, it allows models like BERT to achieve a more nuanced understanding of language compared to simpler word-based approaches, while also being more manageable than character-level tokenization. The comparison with BPE highlights that while the goal of efficient text representation is shared among subword methods, the underlying algorithms for achieving this can vary.

<a id="SentencePiece"></a> The sources indicate that **SentencePiece** is a **subword tokenization method**, placing it within the larger context of different **methods** for splitting text into tokens, such as word tokens, subword tokens, character tokens, and byte tokens.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about SentencePiece within this broader context:

*   **Subword Tokenization:** SentencePiece is explicitly identified as a **tokenizer implementation** used by the **Flan-T5 family of models**. It is grouped with other subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece, which are highlighted as the **most commonly used schemes** in modern Language AI. Subword tokenization, as a whole, aims to balance vocabulary size and the ability to handle unseen words by breaking down words into smaller units.

*   **Usage in Flan-T5:** The source clearly states that the **Flan-T5 (2022)** model uses a tokenizer implementation called **SentencePiece**. This provides a concrete example of a significant language model family that utilizes SentencePiece.

*   **Supported Techniques:** The description of SentencePiece mentions that it **supports both BPE (Byte Pair Encoding) and the unigram language model**. This indicates that SentencePiece is not a single algorithm but rather a framework that can implement different subword tokenization techniques. The unigram language model is briefly described in the source reference but not elaborated upon within the main text.

*   **Handling of Whitespace and Other Characters:** When examining the tokenized text of the example input using the Flan-T5 tokenizer (which uses SentencePiece), the source notes that there are **no newline or whitespace tokens**. This implies that SentencePiece handles whitespace differently compared to some other tokenizers (like the one used by GPT-2, which retains whitespace). The source suggests this characteristic **could make it challenging for the model to work with code**. Additionally, in the Flan-T5 example, **emojis and Chinese characters are replaced by the `<unk>` token**, indicating that the tokenizer, in this particular configuration and training, is **blind to them**.

*   **Language Independence:** The reference for SentencePiece ("SentencePiece: A simple and language independent subword tokenizer and detokenizer for neural text processing") suggests that a key characteristic of SentencePiece is its **language independence**. This likely contributes to its ability to support different underlying algorithms and handle diverse textual data, although the example in the source shows limitations with certain non-alphanumeric characters.

In the larger context of tokenization **methods**, SentencePiece offers a flexible approach to subword tokenization by supporting multiple algorithms. Its use in models like Flan-T5 demonstrates its effectiveness in certain language modeling tasks. However, the example also highlights that the specific choices made during the training of a SentencePiece tokenizer (such as the handling of whitespace and rare characters) can have implications for the model's performance on different types of data. The mention of its language independence suggests an advantage in multilingual applications, even though the provided example doesn't explicitly showcase this.

<a id="Tokenization-free"></a> The sources discuss **tokenization-free encoding** primarily in the context of **byte tokens** as one of the notable **methods** for breaking down text. Here's what the sources say about it within the larger context of tokenization methods:

*   **Byte Tokens as Tokenization-Free Encoding:** The method of breaking down tokens into **individual bytes** that are used to represent Unicode characters is explicitly linked to the concept of **"tokenization-free encoding"**.

*   **Competitive Method:** The sources mention research papers like "CANINE: Pre-training an efficient tokenization-free encoder for language representation" which outline such methods, and "ByT5: Towards a token-free future with pre-trained byte-to-byte models" which shows that this approach can be **competitive**, especially in **multilingual scenarios**. This positions tokenization-free encoding as a viable alternative to traditional tokenization methods.

*   **Distinction from Subword Tokenizers with Byte Fallback:** The sources highlight an important distinction. While some **subword tokenizers** (like GPT-2 and RoBERTa) **include bytes as tokens in their vocabulary** as a final fallback for characters they cannot otherwise represent, this **does not make them tokenization-free byte-level tokenizers**. This is because these tokenizers do not use bytes to represent *everything*, only a subset. True tokenization-free encoding, as implied by the discussion of byte tokens, relies solely on the byte-level representation.

*   **Position within Tokenization Methods:** By discussing byte tokens and tokenization-free encoding alongside word tokens, subword tokens, and character tokens, the sources present it as another fundamental **method** for representing text numerically before it is processed by a language model.

In the larger context of tokenization **methods**, tokenization-free encoding using byte tokens represents an approach that **bypasses the explicit creation of a vocabulary of words, subwords, or characters**. Instead, it operates directly at the level of the underlying byte representation of text. This has potential advantages, particularly in handling diverse character sets in multilingual contexts and avoiding issues with out-of-vocabulary words altogether, as every character is represented by its byte sequence. However, the sources also suggest that other methods, particularly subword tokenization, are currently more prevalent and that even when bytes are included in a tokenizer's vocabulary, it doesn't necessarily equate to a fully tokenization-free approach unless all text is represented at the byte level.

### Token Types <a id="token-types"></a>

The sources discuss several **types of tokens** that arise from different **tokenization methods**, highlighting their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages within the larger context of how Large Language Models (LLMs) process text.

Here's a breakdown of the token types discussed:

*   **Word Tokens:** This approach, common in **earlier NLP methods like word2vec**, involves treating **entire words as individual tokens**. The sources note that while word tokenization was useful and is still employed outside of NLP (e.g., in recommendation systems), it has limitations for LLMs.
    *   A key challenge is dealing with **new words (out-of-vocabulary words)** encountered after the tokenizer is trained.
    *   It can also lead to a **large vocabulary** with many tokens that have only minimal differences (e.g., "apology," "apologize," "apologetic").

*   **Subword Tokens:** The sources emphasize that **subword tokenization is the most commonly used scheme** for modern LLMs. This method breaks down words into **smaller units, which can be full words or parts of words**.
    *   A significant benefit is the **ability to represent new words** by decomposing them into known subword units.
    *   Subword tokenization leads to a **more expressive vocabulary** by having tokens for common word stems and suffixes.
    *   Compared to character tokens, subword tokens allow for **fitting more text within the limited context length** of Transformer models.
    *   Examples of subword tokenization methods discussed include **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** (used by GPT models), **WordPiece** (used by BERT), and **SentencePiece** (used by Flan-T5). The tokenization examples provided for various models (BERT, GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Flan-T5, Phi-3/Llama 2) illustrate the result of subword tokenization, showing words split into smaller components.

*   **Character Tokens:** This method involves treating **each character as a separate token**.
    *   A major advantage is the ability to **handle new words successfully** as the basic alphabet is always part of the vocabulary.
    *   However, the sources point out that character-level tokenization makes **modeling more difficult** because the model needs to learn to form words from individual characters in addition to understanding the higher-level semantics.
    *   Subword tokenization is preferred as it allows more text to fit within the model's context length.

*   **Byte Tokens:** This method breaks down tokens into **individual bytes that represent Unicode characters**, sometimes referred to as "tokenization-free encoding".
    *   The sources mention that this can be a **competitive method, especially in multilingual scenarios**.
    *   It's noted that some **subword tokenizers also include bytes** in their vocabulary as a fallback mechanism for representing characters they cannot otherwise encode (e.g., GPT-2, RoBERTa). However, this does not make them purely byte-level tokenizers as they don't use bytes to represent everything.

*   **Special Tokens:** These are **unique tokens that have a role other than representing text**. The sources discuss various special tokens used by different models:
    *   **`[UNK]` (Unknown token):** Used for tokens the tokenizer has no specific encoding for (e.g., BERT, Flan-T5).
    *   **`[SEP]` (Separator token):** Used to separate texts, especially in tasks requiring two input sequences (e.g., BERT).
    *   **`[PAD]` (Padding token):** Used to pad shorter input sequences to match the expected length (context size) (e.g., BERT, Flan-T5, Galactica).
    *   **`[CLS]` (Classification token):** Used for classification tasks, often added at the beginning of the input (e.g., BERT).
    *   **`[MASK]` (Masking token):** Used to hide tokens during training, a key part of masked language modeling (e.g., BERT).
    *   **`<|endoftext|>`:** Indicates the end of a text sequence (e.g., GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Phi-3/Llama 2).
    *   **Fill in the middle tokens (`<|fim_prefix|>`, `<|fim_middle|>`, `<|fim_suffix|>`, `<fim_pad>`):** Used by models like GPT-4 and StarCoder2 to enable generating completions given text before and after (fill-in-the-middle tasks).
    *   **Repository and filename tokens (`<filename>`, `<reponame>`, `<gh_stars>`):** Used by code-focused models like StarCoder2 to identify the context of code within repositories.
    *   **Citation tokens (`[START_REF]`, `[END_REF]`):** Used by scientific models like Galactica to wrap citations.
    *   **Reasoning token (`<work>`):** Used by Galactica for chain-of-thought reasoning.
    *   **Chat tokens (`<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`)**: Added to tokenizers to indicate turns and roles in conversational LLMs (e.g., Phi-3/Llama 2).
    *   **Beginning and end of sequence tokens (`<s>`, `</s>`):** Used by models like Phi-3/Llama 2 and Flan-T5.

In the larger context of tokenization, the **type of token used is fundamentally tied to the chosen tokenization method** and the specific goals and training data of the LLM. The evolution from word tokens to subword tokens reflects a need for more flexibility and efficiency in representing diverse languages and handling new words. Special tokens play a crucial role in enabling models to understand the structure of input, perform specific tasks, and manage the flow of text generation and conversation. The comparison of different trained tokenizers highlights how the selection and behavior of these token types vary across models, influencing their strengths and weaknesses in different applications.

**Words** <a id="words"></a>

The sources discuss **words** primarily in the context of **word tokens** and how they are handled by different **tokenization methods**, which ultimately determines the **types of tokens** used by Large Language Models (LLMs).

Here's a discussion of what the sources say about words in the larger context of token types:

*   **Word Tokens as a Token Type:** The sources explicitly identify **word tokens** as one of the four notable ways to tokenize text. In this approach, **each individual word in a text is treated as a single token**. This method was common with earlier NLP techniques like word2vec.

*   **Limitations of Word Tokens for LLMs:** While conceptually simple, the sources highlight several drawbacks of relying solely on word tokens for modern LLMs:
    *   **Handling of Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:** If a word appears in the input that was not present in the training data of the tokenizer, the model will not have a specific token for it. This can lead to information loss or the use of a generic `<unk>` (unknown) token, as seen in the BERT uncased and Flan-T5 tokenization examples when encountering emojis or non-English characters.
    *   **Large Vocabulary Size:** Representing every unique word requires a potentially very large vocabulary. This can make the model larger and less efficient. Furthermore, it can lead to many tokens that are very similar (e.g., different inflections of the same root word).

*   **Subword Tokenization and the Breakdown of Words:** The sources emphasize that **subword tokenization is the most prevalent method in contemporary LLMs**. This approach addresses the limitations of word tokens by breaking down words into smaller units called **subword tokens**. These subword tokens can be whole words or parts of words (like stems, suffixes, or prefixes).
    *   **Examples:** The tokenization examples for various models (BERT, GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Phi-3/Llama 2, Flan-T5) clearly illustrate how words are often split into multiple subword tokens. For instance, "CAPITALIZATION" is tokenized differently by various models, often into multiple subword units. Similarly, "tokenization" is broken down into "token" and "##ization" by BERT.
    *   **Advantages:** This allows the model to represent a wider range of words, including new ones, by combining known subword units. It also leads to a more manageable and expressive vocabulary.

*   **Words in Relation to Character and Byte Tokens:** Compared to character tokens (where each character is a token), subword tokenization offers a more meaningful unit that can capture morphemes and common word parts, leading to more efficient modeling. Byte tokens, which represent individual bytes, move further away from the linguistic concept of a "word" but can be beneficial for handling all possible characters and multilingual scenarios. Even in these tokenization schemes, the underlying goal is to represent and process linguistic units, even if those units are smaller than traditional words.

*   **Words and Special Tokens:** The concept of a "word" can sometimes intersect with **special tokens**. For example, while `<|user|>` and `<|assistant|>` are not words in the traditional sense, they represent roles in a conversation, which linguistically frames the subsequent text. Similarly, tokens for repository names (`<reponame>`) or filenames (`<filename>`) in code models relate to the context in which words (code) appear.

In summary, while **word tokens** represent a direct mapping to the linguistic unit of a word, the sources indicate that for the purpose of building powerful and versatile LLMs, **subword tokenization is a more effective approach**. It allows for a balance between representing whole words and breaking them down into smaller, more fundamental units. This enables better handling of unseen words, a more efficient vocabulary, and ultimately contributes to the model's ability to understand and generate human-like language. The other token types, character and byte tokens, represent further deviations from the "word" as a basic unit, each with its own trade-offs in terms of linguistic meaning and representational capacity.

**SubWords** <a id="subwords"></a>

The sources strongly emphasize the importance of **subword tokens** as the **most commonly used tokenization scheme** in contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs). They are presented as a crucial element in bridging the gap between the limitations of word-level and character-level tokenization.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the sources say about subwords in the larger context of token types:

*   **Definition:** Subword tokenization involves breaking down words into **smaller units**, which can be **full words or parts of words**. This means a single word might be represented by one or more subword tokens.

*   **Advantages over Word Tokens:** The sources highlight several key benefits of subword tokens compared to treating entire words as tokens:
    *   **Handling Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words:** A significant advantage is the ability to **represent new, unseen words** by decomposing them into smaller, known subword units. If a new word appears that the tokenizer hasn't encountered before, it can likely be broken down into existing subword tokens, allowing the model to process it to some extent.
    *   **More Expressive Vocabulary:** Subword tokenization leads to a **more efficient and expressive vocabulary**. Instead of needing separate tokens for every variation of a word (e.g., "run," "running," "ran"), subword tokenizers can have a root token ("run") and suffix tokens ("-ing," "-an"), reducing the vocabulary size while still being able to represent various forms.
    *   **Addressing Minimal Differences:** Word tokenization can result in a large vocabulary with many tokens that have only slight differences. Subword tokenization resolves this by having tokens for common word parts (like "apolog") and then separate tokens for suffixes ("-y," "-ize," "-etic," "-ist").

*   **Advantages over Character Tokens:** Subword tokenization also offers benefits compared to using individual characters as tokens:
    *   **Fitting More Context:** Subword tokens allow for **fitting more text within the limited context length** of Transformer models. On average, a subword token often represents more than one character, meaning a model with a fixed context length can process a longer sequence of meaningful units compared to character-level tokenization.
    *   **Easier Modeling:** While character tokens can handle new words, modeling language at the character level is **more difficult** for the model. It needs to learn to form words from individual characters in addition to understanding the semantic relationships. Subword tokens represent more meaningful linguistic units, making the learning process more efficient.

*   **Relationship with Byte Tokens:** Some subword tokenizers, like those used by GPT-2 and RoBERTa, also include individual **bytes** in their vocabulary as a fallback mechanism to represent any character they encounter. This ensures that even truly unseen characters can be represented at a very granular level. However, these are not purely byte-level tokenizers as they primarily rely on subword units.

*   **Examples of Subword Tokenization Methods:** The sources mention several popular subword tokenization methods used by different LLMs:
    *   **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE):** Widely used by GPT models.
    *   **WordPiece:** Used by BERT.
    *   **SentencePiece:** Used by Flan-T5, supporting BPE and the unigram language model.

*   **Impact on Tokenization Examples:** The numerous tokenization examples provided in the sources for models like BERT, GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Flan-T5, and Phi-3/Llama 2 clearly illustrate the application of subword tokenization, showing how words are often split into multiple tokens.

In essence, **subword tokenization represents a crucial advancement in how LLMs process text**. It offers a **balance between the granularity of characters and the semantic meaning of words**, leading to more robust and efficient language models capable of handling a wide range of vocabulary and unseen words effectively. It has become the dominant token type due to its ability to overcome the limitations of earlier tokenization methods.

**Character** <a id="character"></a>

The sources discuss **character tokens** as one of the four notable ways to tokenize text. In the larger context of token types, they offer a very granular approach with specific trade-offs compared to word and subword tokenization.

Hereâ€™s what the sources say about characters as a token type:

*   **Definition:** Character tokens involve treating **each individual character** in a text as a separate token.

*   **Ability to Handle New Words:** One of the main advantages highlighted for character tokens is their ability to **deal successfully with new words**. Since the tokenizer's vocabulary consists of the raw letters, it can represent any new word by simply using the sequence of its constituent characters. This eliminates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word problem faced by word-level tokenizers.

*   **Difficulty in Modeling:** While character tokenization makes the representation easier in terms of handling any possible input, it makes the **modeling more difficult**. The sources provide an example: a model using subword tokenization can represent "play" as one token, whereas a model using character-level tokens needs to model the information to spell out "p-l-a-y" in addition to modeling the rest of the sequence. This means the model has to learn not only the semantics but also the orthography (spelling) of words.

*   **Context Length Efficiency:** The sources state that **subword tokens present an advantage over character tokens** in their ability to fit more text within the limited context length of a Transformer model. A model with subword tokenization might be able to fit about three times as much text compared to using character tokens for the same context length, as subword tokens often average around three characters per token.

*   **Comparison to Word Tokens:** Unlike word tokens, which treat entire words as single units and struggle with OOV words and large vocabularies, character tokens can represent any word but at the cost of increased sequence length and modeling complexity.

*   **Comparison to Subword Tokens:** Subword tokens are presented as a compromise. They can handle new words by breaking them down into smaller parts, leading to a more manageable vocabulary than word tokens and allowing for more semantic information per token than character tokens, thus being more efficient for models with limited context length.

In summary, **character tokens represent the most fine-grained level of tokenization**, offering the advantage of being able to represent any word without encountering out-of-vocabulary issues. However, this granularity comes at the cost of **longer input sequences** and **increased difficulty for the model to learn meaningful representations**, as it needs to learn to form words from individual characters before understanding their meaning and relationships within the text. Consequently, while character tokenization has its benefits, **subword tokenization is generally favored in modern LLMs** for striking a better balance between vocabulary size, handling of unseen words, and modeling efficiency.

**Bytes** <a id="bytes"></a>

The sources discuss **byte tokens** as one of the four notable ways to tokenize text. In the larger context of token types, they represent the **most granular level**, focusing on the underlying digital representation of characters.

Hereâ€™s what the sources say about bytes as a token type:

*   **Definition:** Byte tokens involve breaking down text into the **individual bytes** that are used to represent Unicode characters.

*   **"Tokenization-Free Encoding":** The sources mention that methods using byte tokens are sometimes referred to as "**tokenization-free encoding**". This is because they bypass traditional tokenization methods that rely on linguistic units like words or subwords and directly operate on the raw byte sequences. Examples of research exploring this include "CANINE: Pre-training an efficient tokenization-free encoder for language representation" and "ByT5: Towards a token-free future with pre-trained byte-to-byte models".

*   **Advantages in Multilingual Scenarios:** The "ByT5" work suggests that byte-level tokenization can be a **competitive method**, **especially in multilingual scenarios**. This is likely because bytes provide a universal representation for all characters across different languages, avoiding the need for language-specific tokenizers or dealing with characters not present in a tokenizer's vocabulary.

*   **Fallback Mechanism in Subword Tokenizers:** It's important to note that some **subword tokenizers** (like those used by GPT-2 and RoBERTa) also include **bytes as tokens in their vocabulary**. This serves as a **final fallback** when they encounter characters they cannot represent using their standard subword units. However, the sources explicitly state that this **doesn't make them tokenization-free byte-level tokenizers** because they don't use bytes to represent everything, only a subset of characters. Their primary mode of operation is still based on subword units.

*   **Comparison to Other Token Types:**
    *   **Word Tokens:** Unlike word tokens that operate on whole words and struggle with out-of-vocabulary words, byte tokens can represent any character. However, they lose direct linguistic meaning at the word level.
    *   **Subword Tokens:** While subword tokens aim to strike a balance by breaking words into meaningful parts, byte tokens go even more granular, focusing purely on the underlying representation. Subword tokenizers may incorporate bytes as a fallback, indicating a hierarchical approach where subwords are preferred when possible.
    *   **Character Tokens:** Both character and byte tokens operate at a very fine-grained level. Character tokens focus on the abstract symbols of language, while byte tokens focus on their digital encoding. For languages with complex scripts or where consistent character boundaries are difficult to define, byte tokens might offer a more robust and universal approach.

In summary, **byte tokens represent a fundamental level of text representation**, operating directly on the digital encoding of characters. This approach is particularly advantageous in **handling all possible characters, making it potentially strong for multilingual applications and as a robust fallback**. While some subword tokenizers integrate bytes into their vocabulary, **true byte-level tokenization bypasses linguistic units entirely**, offering a "tokenization-free" method with its own set of trade-offs in terms of direct linguistic meaning and modeling complexity, similar to but even more granular than character-level tokenization.

### Special tokens <a id="special-tokens"></a>

The sources emphasize that **special tokens** are unique tokens within a tokenizer's vocabulary that serve roles beyond representing the content of the text itself. They are a critical aspect of tokenization, influencing how language models understand the structure and context of the input and output sequences.

Here's a discussion of special tokens in the context of tokenization, drawing from the sources:

*   **Definition and Purpose:** Special tokens are **unique tokens** that have a role other than simply representing words or subwords. They are added to the vocabulary for specific functionalities related to the language model's training and usage.

*   **Examples of Common Special Tokens and Their Functions:** The sources provide several examples of special tokens used by different language models:
    *   **Beginning of Text Token (e.g., `<s>`)**: This token often indicates the **start of an input sequence**. Phi-3 and Llama 2 use this.
    *   **End of Text Token (e.g., `<|endoftext|>`, `</s>`)**: This token signals the **end of a text sequence** or the model's completion of generation.
    *   **Padding Token (e.g., `[PAD]`, `<pad>`)**: Used to **pad shorter input sequences** in a batch to a uniform length, as models often expect a certain input size (context size).
    *   **Unknown Token (e.g., `[UNK]`, `<unk>`)**: Represents words or subwords that the **tokenizer has no specific encoding for** in its vocabulary. This helps the model handle out-of-vocabulary words, although it loses specific information about them.
    *   **Classification Token (e.g., `[CLS]`)**: Often used in encoder-only models like BERT for **classification tasks**. It is added at the beginning of the input and its final hidden state is used as the representation for the entire input sequence.
    *   **Separator Token (e.g., `[SEP]`)**: Used to **separate different segments of text** when providing multiple inputs to a model (e.g., in tasks like question answering or comparing two texts). Chapter 8 mentions its use in separating the query and a candidate result in semantic search.
    *   **Masking Token (e.g., `[MASK]`)**: Used during the **training process of models like BERT** for masked language modeling, where parts of the input are hidden for the model to predict.
    *   **Fill in the Middle Tokens (e.g., `<|fim_prefix|>`, `<|fim_middle|>`, `<|fim_suffix|>`, `<fim_prefix>`, `<fim_middle>`, `<fim_suffix>`, `<fim_pad>`)**: Introduced in models like GPT-4 and StarCoder2 to enable the LLM to **generate completions considering both preceding and succeeding text**.
    *   **Chat Tokens (e.g., `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`)**: Added to tokenizers to handle the **conversational nature of chat LLMs**, indicating turns in the conversation and the roles of each speaker.
    *   **Domain-Specific Tokens (e.g., `<filename>`, `<reponame>`, `<gh_stars>`, `[START_REF]`, `[END_REF]`, `<work>`)**: Models focused on specific domains, like StarCoder2 for code or Galactica for science, may include special tokens relevant to their training data and intended use cases. For example, Galactica uses tokens for citations, reasoning, mathematics, and code structures. StarCoder2 uses tokens to identify code within different files and repositories.

*   **Integration into the Tokenization Process:** Before feeding text to a language model, the tokenizer first **breaks down the input into tokens** (words, subwords, characters, or bytes) and then **adds any necessary special tokens** according to the model's architecture and the task. For example, BERT tokenizers wrap the input with `[CLS]` and `[SEP]`. Similarly, during text generation, the model outputs token IDs, which the tokenizer then decodes back into text, including any special tokens that might have been generated (like `<|endoftext|>`).

*   **Importance in Model Functionality:** Special tokens are **crucial for enabling various functionalities** of language models. They provide the model with structural information about the input, demarcate the beginning and end of sequences, handle unknown words, facilitate specific training techniques, and support different interaction paradigms like classification and dialogue.

*   **Tokenizer Design Choice:** The inclusion and type of special tokens are a **key design choice** when creating or training a tokenizer. The specific special tokens used often reflect the model's intended tasks and the characteristics of its training data. Comparing different trained tokenizers (BERT, GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Flan-T5, Phi-3/Llama 2) reveals the **variety of special tokens** and how they are adapted for different purposes, such as code generation, multilingual capabilities, or conversational AI.

In summary, **special tokens are integral to the tokenization process**, extending the representational capabilities beyond just the textual content. They provide crucial signals and structural markers that language models rely on for effective training and performance across a diverse range of tasks and applications. The choice and implementation of special tokens are significant aspects of tokenizer design, tailored to the specific needs and functionalities of the associated language model.

**beginning of text** <a id="beginningoftext"></a>

The sources highlight that the **beginning of text tokens**, such as `<s>` and `[CLS]`, are a type of **special token** used within the tokenization process to provide crucial structural information to language models. In the larger context of special tokens, they serve to mark the **start of an input sequence**, enabling the model to understand the boundaries and context of the text it is processing.

Here's a more detailed discussion of `<s>` and `[CLS]` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **`<s>` (Beginning of Text Token):**
    *   This token is explicitly mentioned as the **beginning of text token** (e.g., `<s>`) and is a common choice among LLM designers.
    *   The **Phi-3 and Llama 2** models are specifically cited as using the `<s>` special token.
    *   In the example of tokenizing text for Phi-3 and Llama 2, the `<s>` token appears at the very beginning of the tokenized sequence.
    *   Similar to other special tokens, `<s>` does not represent a word or subword from the text but signals a specific structural aspect of the input.

*   **`[CLS]` (Classification Token):**
    *   The `[CLS]` token is described as a **special classification token**.
    *   It is primarily used in **encoder-only models like BERT** for **classification tasks**.
    *   During the tokenization process for BERT, the `[CLS]` token is **added at the beginning of the input text**.
    *   The source notes that the `[CLS]` token serves a utility purpose in **wrapping the input text**.
    *   For classification, the **final hidden state of the `[CLS]` token** is often used as an aggregate representation of the entire input sequence. This allows the model to learn a single vector that encapsulates the overall meaning of the text for classification purposes.
    *   The source provides an example of tokenized text using the BERT base model (uncased), where `[CLS]` is the very first token. The same applies to the cased version of BERT.

*   **Similarities and Differences in Purpose:**
    *   Both `<s>` and `[CLS]` are placed at the **beginning of the input sequence**, indicating the start of the text for the model.
    *   They are both **special tokens** that do not directly correspond to the words in the input text but carry additional meaning for the model.
    *   However, their primary intended uses differ. **`<s>` generally marks the start of a text sequence**, which is a fundamental aspect for many language models, especially generative ones. **`[CLS]` has a more specific role in classification tasks** within encoder-only architectures like BERT, where its final hidden state is leveraged for the classification output.
    *   While `<s>` is mentioned in the context of generative models like Phi-3 and Llama 2, `[CLS]` is specifically associated with the architecture and training objectives of representation models like BERT.

In the larger context of special tokens, both `<s>` and `[CLS]` demonstrate how these non-content tokens are strategically incorporated into the tokenization process to imbue the input with structural and task-specific information. The presence and function of these beginning-of-text tokens vary depending on the language model's architecture (encoder-only vs. decoder-only) and its intended applications (e.g., general text generation vs. specific classification tasks). They highlight the deliberate design choices in tokenization that go beyond simply breaking text into smaller units.


**end of text** <a id="endoftext"></a>

The sources indicate that **end of text tokens**, such as `</s>` and `[SEP]`, are crucial **special tokens** used during the tokenization process to signal the **end of a text sequence** to a language model. In the broader context of special tokens, they provide necessary structural cues for the model to understand the boundaries of the input or generated text.

Here's a detailed discussion of `</s>` and `[SEP]` as end of text special tokens:

*   **`</s>` (End of Text Token):**
    *   This token is explicitly mentioned as a common choice for the **end of text token**.
    *   The **Flan-T5** model is specifically cited as using `</s>` as a special token. In the tokenized text example for Flan-T5, `</s>` appears at the end of the sequence.
    *   The **GPT-2 and BLIP-2** models also use `</s>` as their end of text token, although in the BLIP-2 example, it's also listed as the beginning of text and unknown token.
    *   Similar to other special tokens, `</s>` does not represent content from the text but indicates the termination of a sequence.

*   **`[SEP]` (Separator Token):**
    *   The `[SEP]` token is described as a **separator** that enables certain tasks requiring the model to process **two texts simultaneously** (in which case the model is termed a cross-encoder).
    *   The source mentions **reranking** (discussed in Chapter 8) as one example of a task where `[SEP]` is used. In this context, it serves to **separate the text of the query and a candidate result**.
    *   The **BERT base model (uncased)** uses `[SEP]` as one of its special tokens. In the tokenized text example for BERT, `[SEP]` appears at the very end of the input. The cased version of BERT also uses `[SEP]`.
    *   Like other special tokens, `[SEP]` does not represent a word or subword but provides structural separation within the input.

*   **Similarities and Differences in Purpose:**
    *   Both `</s>` and `[SEP]` are typically placed at or near the **end of a text sequence**, signaling a form of completion or separation.
    *   They are both **special tokens** that do not directly correspond to the words in the input text but carry additional meaning for the model regarding sequence boundaries or text segment separation.
    *   However, their primary intended uses differ. **`</s>` mainly signifies the end of a complete text sequence**, which is crucial for generative models to know when to stop generating. **`[SEP]` has a more specific role in demarcating distinct segments of text within a single input**, primarily in tasks that involve processing multiple pieces of text, such as question answering or comparing texts.

In the larger context of special tokens, both `</s>` and `[SEP]` illustrate how these non-content tokens are strategically incorporated into the tokenization process to provide essential structural information to language models. The choice of which end of text token (or both) to use depends on the language model's architecture (e.g., generative vs. representation) and the specific tasks it is designed to perform. They underscore the importance of these designed tokens in enabling models to correctly interpret and process textual data by clearly defining the boundaries and segments within it.


**Padding** <a id="padding"></a>

The sources explain that the **padding token ([PAD])** is a type of **special token** used in language models. In the larger context of special tokens, **`[PAD]` serves a technical role related to the processing of input sequences**, ensuring uniformity in length when feeding data to the model.

Here's a detailed discussion of `[PAD]` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **Purpose of the Padding Token:**
    *   The `[PAD]` token is explicitly described as a **padding token used to pad unused positions in the modelâ€™s input**.
    *   This is necessary because language models, particularly Transformer-based models, often **expect a certain length of input, referred to as their context size**.
    *   Since input sequences (text, code, etc.) can vary in length, padding is applied to shorter sequences to make them match the length of the longest sequence in a batch, or a predefined maximum length. This ensures that all inputs in a batch have the same dimensions, which is crucial for efficient computation.

*   **Models Utilizing Padding Tokens:**
    *   The **BERT base model (uncased)** is explicitly listed as using `[PAD]` as one of its special tokens.
    *   The **BERT base model (cased)** also uses `[PAD]` as a special token.
    *   The **Flan-T5** family of models also uses a padding token, denoted as **`<pad>`**.

*   **Relationship to Other Special Tokens:**
    *   Unlike **content-related special tokens** like the **masking token (`[MASK]`)** which is part of the pretraining objective (as we discussed earlier), the **unknown token (`[UNK]`)** which handles out-of-vocabulary words, or **end-of-text tokens (`<|endoftext|>`, `[SEP]`)** which signal sequence boundaries, the `[PAD]` token has a **purely technical function**. Its presence doesn't contribute directly to the semantic understanding of the input.
    *   While **classification tokens (`[CLS]`)** have a specific role in downstream tasks like classification, and **domain-specific tokens** like **`<filename>`** and **`<reponame>`** (used by StarCoder2) encode contextual information about the input source, the `[PAD]` token serves to make the input data structurally consistent for the model's processing pipeline.
    *   Similar to how we discussed that conversational tokens (`<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`) delineate roles in a dialogue, `[PAD]` focuses on the technical requirement of uniform input length, regardless of the content.
    *   When preparing data for tasks like named-entity recognition, the process of **tokenization might involve adding padding** to create equally sized representations. This highlights the role of `[PAD]` in preparing data for the model after the initial tokenization step.

In the larger context of special tokens, `[PAD]` demonstrates how these tokens can serve essential technical purposes beyond encoding linguistic or domain-specific information. It ensures that the model can process batches of variable-length sequences efficiently without needing to handle different input dimensions for each sequence. While it doesn't contribute to the semantic understanding like other special tokens, it is a crucial component for the practical implementation and training of many language models.

**unknown** <a id="unknown"></a>

The sources explain that the **unknown token ([UNK])** is a critical **special token** used during the tokenization process. In the larger context of special tokens, **[UNK] serves as a placeholder for any word or subword in the input text that the tokenizer's vocabulary does not contain a specific encoding for**.

Here's a more detailed discussion of `[UNK]` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **Purpose of the Unknown Token:**
    *   The `[UNK]` token is explicitly defined as an **unknown token that the tokenizer has no specific encoding for**.
    *   This situation arises when the tokenizer encounters a word or subword that was not part of its training dataset or was below a certain frequency threshold during vocabulary creation.
    *   By having an `[UNK]` token, the model can still process the input sequence even if it contains words it hasn't seen before, rather than completely failing to handle them.

*   **Models Utilizing Unknown Tokens:**
    *   The **BERT base model (uncased)** is explicitly listed as using `[UNK]` as one of its special tokens. The tokenized text example for BERT shows that the emoji and Chinese characters in the input are replaced with `[UNK]`, indicating that the uncased BERT tokenizer did not have these characters in its vocabulary.
    *   The **BERT base model (cased)** also uses `[UNK]` as a special token, and its tokenized example similarly shows `[UNK]` replacing the emoji and Chinese characters.
    *   The **Flan-T5** model uses `<unk>` as its unknown token. The example shows that both the emoji and the Chinese characters in the input are replaced by `<unk>`, signifying that the Flan-T5 tokenizer also lacked specific encodings for them.
    *   The **Galactica** model includes `<unk>` in its list of special tokens.
    *   The **BLIP-2** tokenizer lists `<s>` as the beginning of text, end of text, and **unknown token**.

*   **Relationship to Tokenizer Vocabulary and Training Data:**
    *   The presence of `[UNK]` tokens in tokenized text highlights the limitations of a tokenizer's vocabulary. A tokenizer is trained on a specific dataset to establish the best vocabulary for representing that data.
    *   If the input text contains words or characters that were not frequent enough or not present in the training data, the tokenizer will not have a specific token for them and will instead map them to `[UNK]`.
    *   As noted in the context of BERT, the replacement of emojis and Chinese characters with `[UNK]` demonstrates how a tokenizer trained primarily on English text might not have representations for characters from other languages or symbolic representations.

*   **Impact on Model Performance:**
    *   The frequent appearance of `[UNK]` tokens in the input can potentially impact a language model's performance, as the model has no specific information about the meaning or context of these unknown tokens. It has to rely on the surrounding tokens to infer any relevant information.
    *   Tokenizers with larger vocabularies, or those trained on more diverse datasets, tend to produce fewer `[UNK]` tokens. For example, GPT-4 with a vocabulary size of over 100,000 seems to handle a wider range of characters without resorting to unknown tokens in the provided example.

In the larger context of special tokens, `[UNK]` illustrates how tokenization needs to handle words outside of its known vocabulary. While other special tokens like `<s>`, `</s>`, `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, and `[PAD]` provide structural or task-specific information, `[UNK]` is a mechanism for dealing with the inherent openness of language and the possibility of encountering unseen words. It represents a trade-off between having a manageable vocabulary size and the ability to process any arbitrary input text, even if some parts of it are treated as unknown.

**masking** <a id="masking"></a>

The sources explain that the **masking token ([MASK])** is a specific type of **special token** primarily used during the **pretraining phase of certain language models**, such as BERT. In the larger context of special tokens, `[MASK]` plays a crucial role in enabling a particular self-supervised learning technique called **masked language modeling (MLM)**.

Here's a detailed discussion of `[MASK]` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **Purpose of the Masking Token:**
    *   The `[MASK]` token is explicitly described as a **masking token used to hide tokens during the training process**.
    *   The core idea behind using `[MASK]` is to create a task where the model needs to **predict the masked (hidden) tokens** based on the context of the surrounding unmasked tokens.
    *   This prediction task forces the model to **learn the relationships and dependencies between words** in a sentence, leading to better understanding and representation of contextual language.

*   **Models Utilizing Masking Tokens:**
    *   The **BERT base model (uncased)** is explicitly listed as using `[MASK]` as one of its special tokens.
    *   The **BERT base model (cased)** also uses `[MASK]` as a special token.
    *   These BERT models adopted masked language modeling as a key technique in their pretraining.

*   **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):**
    *   The sources explain that **training encoder stacks (like those in BERT) can be a difficult task, and BERT approaches this by adopting MLM**.
    *   As illustrated in Figure 1-22, this method involves **masking a part of the input for the model to predict**.
    *   This prediction task, while difficult, allows BERT to **create more accurate (intermediate) representations of the input**.
    *   **Continued pretraining** on a pretrained BERT model can involve further use of masking to update subword representations and improve performance on downstream tasks.

*   **Relationship to Other Special Tokens:**
    *   Unlike end of text tokens (`</s>`, `[SEP]`) which signal sequence boundaries, or padding tokens (`[PAD]`) which serve a technical purpose for input uniformity, the `[MASK]` token is **directly involved in the learning process** of certain models.
    *   While the `[UNK]` token handles words outside the vocabulary, `[MASK]` deals with words within the vocabulary but temporarily hides them to facilitate learning contextual relationships.
    *   The `[CLS]` token, another special token used by BERT for classification tasks, has a different role than `[MASK]`, highlighting the variety of purposes special tokens can serve.

*   **Masking Strategies:**
    *   The sources mention that **masking can occur at the token level or the whole-word level**.
    *   **Token masking** involves randomly masking a percentage of the tokens, which might result in only part of a word being masked.
    *   **Whole-word masking** aims to mask entire words, which can lead to the model learning more accurate and precise representations but might take longer to converge.

In the larger context of special tokens, `[MASK]` demonstrates how these specifically designed tokens can be integral to the pretraining methodologies that enable language models to learn rich and contextualized representations of language. It highlights a key difference between models like BERT, which utilize masked language modeling, and generative models like GPT, which do not rely on this technique and therefore do not typically use a `[MASK]` token in the same way.

**filename** <a id="filename"></a>

The sources indicate that the **`<filename>`** token is a **special token** used by the **StarCoder2 model**. In the larger context of special tokens, **`<filename>` serves a specific purpose related to the domain of code generation**, which is the focus of the StarCoder2 model.

Here's a more detailed discussion of `<filename>` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **Purpose of the `<filename>` Token:**
    *   The source explains that when representing code, **managing the context is important**. A single code repository might contain multiple files where a function call in one file refers to a function defined in another.
    *   To enable the model to **identify code that is in different files within the same code repository**, while also distinguishing it from code in different repositories, StarCoder2 utilizes the `<filename>` special token.
    *   Therefore, the `<filename>` token provides the model with **information about the specific file from which a code snippet originates**.

*   **Model Utilizing the `<filename>` Token:**
    *   The **StarCoder2 model (2024)** is explicitly mentioned as using `<filename>` as one of its special tokens.
    *   StarCoder2 is described as a **15-billion parameter model focused on generating code**.

*   **Relationship to Other Special Tokens:**
    *   Similar to other special tokens like **`<|endoftext|>`** (indicating the end of generation) and the **fill-in-the-middle tokens** (`<fim_prefix>`, `<fim_middle>`, `<fim_suffix>`, `<fim_pad>`) also used by StarCoder2, the `<filename>` token provides **structural or contextual information** that is specific to the task the model is designed for (code generation in this case).
    *   Unlike general special tokens like **`[PAD]`** (for input uniformity), **`[UNK]`** (for out-of-vocabulary words), or **`[MASK]`** (used in pretraining for models like BERT), the `<filename>` token is **domain-specific**, tailored to help the model understand the organization and context within a codebase.
    *   It also differs from conversational turn tokens like **`<|user|>`** and **`<|assistant|>`** used by Phi-3 and Llama 2, as its purpose is not to delineate speakers in a dialogue but to provide file-level context in code.
    *   The use of `<filename>` highlights how special tokens can be **customized and extended** to address the specific needs and nuances of different language modeling tasks and domains.

In the larger context of special tokens, `<filename>` exemplifies the **versatility and task-specificity** that these tokens can offer. While some special tokens serve general technical purposes or mark common linguistic structures, others, like `<filename>`, are designed to encode information that is particularly relevant for the model's intended application, in this case, understanding and generating code within a multi-file project. This demonstrates how the vocabulary and special tokens of a language model are carefully considered during its design to optimize its performance for specific tasks.

**reponame** <a id="reponame"></a>

The sources indicate that the **`<reponame>`** token is a **special token** used by the **StarCoder2 model**. In the larger context of special tokens, **`<reponame>` serves a specific purpose related to providing context within a codebase for the model focused on code generation**.

Here's a more detailed discussion of `<reponame>` within the framework of special tokens:

*   **Purpose of the `<reponame>` Token:**
    *   Similar to the `<filename>` token, the `<reponame>` token is used by StarCoder2 to **manage the context when representing code**.
    *   The source explains that the model needs a way to distinguish between code in **different files within the same code repository** and, crucially, between code in **different repositories altogether**.
    *   The `<reponame>` token provides the model with **information about the specific repository from which a code snippet originates**. This allows the model to better understand the scope and dependencies of the code it is processing or generating.

*   **Model Utilizing the `<reponame>` Token:**
    *   The **StarCoder2 model (2024)** is explicitly mentioned as using `<reponame>` as one of its special tokens.
    *   As we discussed previously, StarCoder2 is a model specifically designed for **generating code**.

*   **Relationship to Other Special Tokens:**
    *   The `<reponame>` token, alongside `<filename>`, **`<|endoftext|>`**, and the fill-in-the-middle tokens, belongs to the category of **task-specific special tokens** used by StarCoder2. These tokens are designed to encode information crucial for understanding and generating code.
    *   It is **distinct from general technical tokens** like **`[PAD]`** (for padding inputs to a uniform length) and **`[UNK]`** (for handling out-of-vocabulary words) that we discussed in the context of BERT and other models.
    *   It also differs from **learning-related special tokens** like **`[MASK]`** used in BERT's pretraining, as `<reponame>` provides contextual information rather than facilitating a specific training objective.
    *   While **conversational tokens** like **`<|user|>`** and **`<|assistant|>`** (used by models like Phi-3 and Llama 2) delineate turns in a dialogue, `<reponame>` focuses on the organizational context of code within a repository.
    *   The inclusion of `<reponame>` demonstrates how the set of special tokens can be **extended and tailored** to the specific domain and task of a language model. For a code generation model like StarCoder2, understanding the repository context is vital for generating coherent and relevant code, especially in projects spanning multiple files and repositories.

In the larger context of special tokens, `<reponame>` further illustrates the **principle of task-specificity**. Just as `<filename>` provides file-level context, `<reponame>` adds a higher level of organization by indicating the repository. These tokens demonstrate how the vocabulary of a language model, including its special tokens, is carefully crafted to enable the model to effectively handle the nuances and complexities of its intended domain, in this case, code generation within a structured project environment.

### Impact on Model <a id="impact-on-model"></a>

The sources emphasize that **tokenization is a fundamental first step in how language models process text**, transforming raw text into sequences of tokens that the model can understand. The way this tokenization is performed has a significant impact on the language model's capabilities and performance.

Here's how the sources discuss the impact of tokenization on models:

*   **Input Representation:** Language models do not directly process text; instead, they operate on **numerical representations of tokens called embeddings**. The tokenizer is responsible for breaking down the input text into these tokens before they are converted into embeddings. Therefore, the quality and nature of the tokens directly influence the input the model receives.

*   **Vocabulary Size and Handling of Novel Words:**
    *   Different tokenization methods lead to varying vocabulary sizes. **Word-level tokenization** can result in very large vocabularies and struggle with **new words** not seen during training.
    *   **Subword tokenization**, used by many modern LLMs like GPT and BERT, addresses this by breaking words into smaller, more frequent units (subwords). This allows the model to represent a wider range of words, including new ones, by combining known subword tokens.
    *   **Character-level tokenization** can also handle new words by falling back to individual letters, but it can make **modeling more difficult** as the model needs to learn to form words from characters. Additionally, it can lead to longer input sequences, potentially exceeding the model's context length.
    *   **Byte-level tokenization** can be particularly useful in **multilingual scenarios**.

*   **Model Performance and Efficiency:**
    *   The choice of tokenization can affect the **efficiency** of the model. For example, **subword tokenization** generally allows for fitting more text within a Transformer model's limited context length compared to character tokenization.
    *   Tokenization choices can be **tuned to improve performance on specific tasks**. The example of whitespace handling in code highlights this: a tokenizer that uses a single token for multiple whitespace characters is better suited for understanding Python code indentation, making the model's job easier.

*   **Special Tokens and Task-Specific Capabilities:**
    *   Tokenizers often include **special tokens** that have roles beyond representing text, such as marking the beginning or end of sequences (`<s>`, `<|endoftext|>`, `[SEP]`), handling unknown words (`[UNK]`, `<unk>`), or facilitating specific tasks like classification (`[CLS]`, `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`) or code understanding (`<filename>`, `<reponame>`). These special tokens provide **structural and contextual information** that guides the model.
    *   The inclusion and design of special tokens are crucial for enabling models to perform various tasks effectively. For instance, StarCoder2's use of `<filename>` and `<reponame>` tokens aims to help the model understand code within a multi-file repository. Similarly, chat models like Phi-3 and Llama 2 use special tokens to distinguish between user, assistant, and system turns in a conversation.

*   **Tokenization and Embeddings are Linked:** The tokenizer's output (the sequence of tokens) is directly fed into the model's embedding layer, which converts each token into a vector representation. Therefore, the **vocabulary of the tokenizer determines the set of tokens for which the model learns embeddings**. A mismatch between the tokenizer and the model would prevent proper functioning.

*   **Impact of Training Data on Tokenizer Behavior:** Even with the same tokenization method and parameters, a tokenizer trained on a **specific dataset** will behave differently and will be optimized to represent that data effectively. For example, a tokenizer trained on English text will differ from one trained on code or multilingual text. This highlights the importance of **aligning the tokenizer's training data with the model's intended use case**.

In summary, **tokenization is a critical preprocessing step that significantly influences how a language model understands and processes text**. The choice of tokenization method, vocabulary size, special tokens, and the data on which the tokenizer is trained all have a direct impact on the model's ability to represent language, handle unseen words, perform specific tasks, and ultimately, its overall performance and effectiveness. The design of the tokenizer is therefore a crucial aspect of building and utilizing language models for various applications.

* [**vocabulary size**](#vocabulary-size)
* [**handling of whitespace**](#handlingofwhitespace)
* [**performance on specific task**](#performance)


**vocabulary size** <a id="vocabulary-size"></a>

The sources indicate that **vocabulary size** is a crucial parameter in the tokenization process and has a significant impact on language models. In the larger context of tokenization's impact on models, the **size of the vocabulary directly affects the model's ability to represent language, handle different types of text, and its overall efficiency**.

Here's a breakdown of what the sources say about vocabulary size and its impact:

*   **Definition and Determination:** Vocabulary size refers to **how many unique tokens the tokenizer is designed to recognize and represent**. This size is a key design choice made when creating a tokenizer. The tokenization method employed (word, subword, character, or byte) heavily influences the resulting vocabulary size.

*   **Impact of Tokenization Methods on Vocabulary Size:**
    *   **Word-level tokenization**, common in earlier NLP methods, could lead to **very large vocabularies**, especially as new words appear in the data after the tokenizer is trained. This can make the model larger and potentially more difficult to train and manage.
    *   **Subword tokenization**, used by many modern LLMs, aims to create a more **efficient set of tokens**. By breaking words into smaller, more frequent units, subword tokenization can achieve good coverage of the language with a **more manageable vocabulary size**. Examples include GPT-2 (vocabulary size: 50,257) and StarCoder2 (vocabulary size: 49,152).
    *   **Character-level tokenization** results in a **small vocabulary** (the set of characters in the language) but can make modeling more difficult as the model has to learn to form words from individual characters.
    *   **Byte-level tokenization** also leads to a relatively **small vocabulary** (256 for byte values) and can be effective for handling multilingual text.

*   **Handling of Unknown Words:** The vocabulary size directly relates to how a model handles words not seen during the tokenizer's training. Tokenizers often include a special **unknown token (`[UNK]`, `<unk>`)** to represent words that are outside of their defined vocabulary. A larger and more well-designed vocabulary (like those in subword tokenizers) can **reduce the frequency of unknown tokens**, allowing the model to better understand the input. For example, the uncased BERT tokenizer replaced "capitalization" with `[UNK]` and `[UNK]`, while the cased version broke it down into subwords, demonstrating the impact of vocabulary and casing on handling a single word.

*   **Model Capacity and Performance:** The vocabulary size influences the **size of the model's embedding layer**. For each token in the vocabulary, the model learns an embedding vector. A larger vocabulary means a larger embedding matrix, which increases the **number of parameters in the model**, potentially leading to greater representational capacity but also increased memory footprint and training time. However, simply having a large vocabulary doesn't guarantee better performance; the quality and relevance of the tokens are also crucial.

*   **Task-Specific Vocabularies:** Certain models designed for specific domains may have vocabularies tailored to that domain. For example, Galactica, focused on scientific knowledge, includes special tokens for citations, reasoning, mathematics, amino acid sequences, and DNA sequences. Similarly, GPT-4's tokenizer has specific tokens for Python keywords like "elif" and sequences of whitespace, reflecting its focus on both natural language and code. This shows how **vocabulary can be adapted to improve performance on targeted tasks**.

*   **Evolution of Vocabulary Sizes:** The sources mention that vocabulary sizes around **30K and 50K** are often used, but there is a trend towards **larger sizes like 100K**, as seen with GPT-4 (a little over 100,000). This increase often aims to provide finer-grained representations and better handle the complexities of diverse text and code.

In essence, the **vocabulary size is a critical factor that interacts with the chosen tokenization method to define the basic units of language that a model can process**. It affects the model's ability to understand and generate text, its capacity, efficiency, and how it deals with unseen words. The trend towards subword tokenization with carefully chosen vocabulary sizes, often incorporating task-specific tokens, highlights the importance of this design choice in creating effective and versatile language models.


**handling of whitespace** <a id="handlingofwhitespace"></a>

The sources highlight that the **handling of whitespace during tokenization has a notable impact on a language model's ability to understand and process text, particularly in contexts like code and the preservation of structural information**. Different tokenizers adopt varying strategies for dealing with whitespace, each with its own implications.

Here's what the sources say about the handling of whitespace and its impact on models:

*   **Whitespace as a Delimiter:** The most common initial method for tokenization involves **splitting text on whitespace to create individual words (tokens)**. However, this approach has limitations, especially for languages without explicit word separators like Mandarin.

*   **Whitespace in Code:** The sources emphasize the **importance of whitespace for models that need to understand or generate code**. In programming languages like Python, whitespace (spaces and tabs) is crucial for indicating indentation and block structure.

*   **Varying Tokenizer Behavior with Whitespace:** Different tokenizers handle whitespace in distinct ways:
    *   **BERT's uncased tokenizer** removes newline breaks, making the model blind to information encoded in them. It also indicates word boundaries differently using the `##` prefix for subword tokens.
    *   In the example given in the context of whitespace significance, a model that uses a **single token to represent four consecutive whitespace characters** is considered **more tuned to a Python code dataset**. Representing each whitespace individually makes it more difficult for the model to track indentation levels, potentially leading to worse performance.
    *   The **Flan-T5 family** using SentencePiece has **no newline or whitespace tokens**, which would make it challenging for the model to work with code.
    *   **GPT-4's tokenizer** is noted for representing **four spaces as a single token** and having specific tokens for sequences of whitespace up to 83 spaces. This reflects the model's focus on code in addition to natural language.
    *   **StarCoder2**, an encoder focused on code generation, **similarly encodes lists of whitespaces as a single token**.
    *   The **Galactica tokenizer**, like StarCoder2, treats whitespaces by assigning a **single token to sequences of whitespace of different lengths**. It uniquely also does this for tabs, assigning a single token to two consecutive tabs (`\t\t'`).
    *   **Phi-3** (and Llama 2), reusing the Llama 2 tokenizer, shows an example where multiple spaces between words like "two tabs :" " " and "Three tabs : " " " are seemingly preserved in the tokenized output.

*   **Impact on Model Understanding:** The way whitespace is tokenized directly affects what information is preserved and how the model processes it. **For code-focused models, accurately representing indentation through tokenization choices can lead to improved performance**. Conversely, tokenizers that discard or normalize whitespace might struggle with tasks where this information is semantically important. The ability of GPT-4 and StarCoder2 to tokenize sequences of whitespace into single tokens suggests an **explicit design choice to better handle code structure**.

*   **Tokenizer Training Data:** The domain of the data used to train the tokenizer influences how it treats whitespace. A tokenizer trained on a codebase will likely handle whitespace in a way that reflects its importance in that domain, as seen with GPT-4 and StarCoder2.

In the larger context of impact on models, the handling of whitespace during tokenization is a specific example of how **low-level preprocessing choices can have significant consequences for a model's effectiveness, particularly when dealing with structured text like code**. Tokenizers designed for different purposes make different trade-offs in how they represent whitespace, reflecting the specific requirements of their intended use cases. Preserving and appropriately tokenizing whitespace can enhance a model's ability to learn and reason about code structure, while in other contexts, normalization or different representations might be more suitable.

**performance** <a id="performance"></a>

The sources discuss the **performance of language models on specific tasks** in various contexts, highlighting how model architecture, training data, tokenization, fine-tuning, and evaluation methodologies contribute to their effectiveness. This performance on specific tasks has a profound **impact on our understanding of the models' capabilities, their applications, and the ongoing development in the field of Language AI**.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what the sources say:

*   **Code Generation Performance:** Several sources emphasize the importance of handling whitespace and code-specific tokens for **code generation models**.
    *   Tokenizers that represent sequences of whitespace as single tokens, as seen in **GPT-4** and **StarCoder2**, are considered **more tuned to code datasets**, making it easier for the model to understand and generate code that relies heavily on indentation.
    *   The **Galactica tokenizer**'s special treatment of whitespace and tabs similarly suggests a focus on handling structured data like code.
    *   Conversely, tokenizers like **Flan-T5's SentencePiece**, which lack specific whitespace tokens, might be less effective for code-related tasks [our conversation history].

*   **Text Classification Performance:** The sources extensively cover text classification as a specific task, demonstrating how different types of models and fine-tuning techniques impact performance.
    *   **Task-specific representation models**, like Twitter-RoBERTa-base for sentiment analysis, show good performance on their trained domain but might generalize differently to other domains like movie reviews.
    *   **Fine-tuning foundation models** (like BERT) on specific classification datasets can yield **better performance** than using pretrained task-specific models, as demonstrated by fine-tuning BERT on movie reviews.
    *   Using **embedding models** to generate text representations followed by training a separate classifier (like logistic regression) is another effective approach for classification, especially when a task-specific model isn't readily available.
    *   **Generative models** like Flan-T5 and ChatGPT can also be used for classification through **prompt engineering**, guiding them to generate labels based on input text. The performance of ChatGPT on sentiment classification of movie reviews (F1 score of 0.91) highlights the potential of these models even without specific fine-tuning for the task.

*   **Sentiment Analysis Performance:** The use of the Twitter-RoBERTa-base model specifically for sentiment analysis and the comparison of its performance on movie reviews illustrates how models trained on a particular sentiment task perform. Additionally, the application of Flan-T5 and ChatGPT to sentiment classification showcases the versatility of generative models for this task.

*   **Search and Retrieval Performance:** The sources discuss how language models have significantly impacted search through **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
    *   **Dense retrieval** systems rely on embedding models to find semantically similar documents to a query, showcasing the performance of embedding models on information retrieval tasks.
    *   **Reranking models** (like monoBERT) improve search results by scoring the relevance of candidate documents to a query, demonstrating the ability of LLMs to refine search rankings.
    *   **RAG systems** combine retrieval with generative models to produce more factual answers grounded in retrieved documents, highlighting the collaborative performance of retrieval and generation components. The success of these systems in reducing "hallucinations" underscores the impact of task-specific design on improving factual accuracy.

*   **Reasoning Performance:** Techniques like **chain-of-thought prompting** aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of generative models on complex tasks like mathematical questions. While not a specific task in itself, this demonstrates efforts to enhance performance on tasks requiring logical inference.

*   **Multimodal Task Performance:** The introduction of multimodal LLMs like BLIP-2 shows the expansion of language models to handle tasks involving both text and images, such as answering questions about images. This signifies progress in extending the "performance" of LLMs beyond just language-based tasks.

*   **Fine-tuning Impact on Task Performance:** Chapter 12 is dedicated to **fine-tuning generation models**, emphasizing how this process adapts pretrained models to exhibit desired behavior on specific tasks. Supervised fine-tuning and preference tuning are presented as key methods to enhance performance on instruction following and generating human-preferred outputs. The improved instruction-following ability of a fine-tuned model compared to the base model directly demonstrates the impact of fine-tuning on task-specific behavior.

*   **Evaluation of Task Performance:** The sources discuss various **evaluation metrics and benchmarks** used to assess the performance of language models on different tasks. For text classification, **F1 score**, precision, and recall are used. For search systems, **mean average precision (MAP)** and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) are mentioned. For generative models, perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore, and benchmarks like MMLU, GLUE, and HumanEval (for code) are discussed. These evaluation methods are crucial for understanding and comparing model performance on specific tasks.

In the larger context of impact on models, the performance on specific tasks drives:

*   **Model Development:** Understanding how different architectures, training methods, and tokenization strategies affect performance on tasks like code generation, classification, and search guides the development of new and improved models. The evolution from BERT to more specialized models and the emergence of multimodal models are examples of this task-driven progress.
*   **Application Design:** The demonstrated capabilities of LLMs on specific tasks inform how these models can be applied in real-world systems, such as chatbots leveraging RAG, code editors using advanced language models, and search engines employing semantic understanding.
*   **Fine-tuning Strategies:** The success of fine-tuning in enhancing performance on downstream tasks (like classification or instruction following) highlights the importance of this step in adapting general-purpose models for specific applications.
*   **Evaluation Frameworks:** The need to measure performance on diverse tasks necessitates the development of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks and metrics, allowing for objective comparison and progress tracking in the field.
*   **Understanding Model Strengths and Weaknesses:** By evaluating models on specific tasks, we gain insights into their strengths (e.g., ChatGPT's strong zero-shot classification) and weaknesses (e.g., LLMs' initial struggle with factual accuracy leading to RAG), which in turn directs research efforts.

Ultimately, the focus on **performance on specific tasks** is central to the advancement and practical application of large language models. It allows researchers and practitioners to iteratively improve models, tailor them to specific needs, and rigorously evaluate their capabilities, leading to a deeper understanding of their potential and limitations.

### Examples <a id="examples"></a>

The sources highlight the crucial role of **examples** in understanding and comparing **tokenization**. Examples are extensively used throughout the book to illustrate how different tokenizers break down text into tokens.

Here's a breakdown of how examples relate to tokenization based on the provided text:

*   **Illustrating the Tokenization Process:** The book uses concrete examples to show how a given input text is processed by a tokenizer. For instance, Figure 2-3 shows how GPT-4's tokenizer breaks down a sentence into colored tokens. Code examples are provided to demonstrate how to load a language model and its tokenizer and then tokenize input text, showing the resulting tokens and their IDs.

*   **Demonstrating Different Tokenization Outcomes:** A significant portion of Chapter 2 is dedicated to comparing various trained LLM tokenizers (BERT, GPT-2, Flan-T5, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Galactica, Phi-3, and Llama 2) by encoding a specific example text. By showing the tokenized output for each model on the same input, the book effectively illustrates:
    *   **Differences in handling capitalization:** Uncased BERT turns all capital letters into lowercase, while cased BERT and other tokenizers preserve capitalization, leading to different tokenizations of the same word (e.g., "CAPITALIZATION" in BERT cased vs. uncased).
    *   **Treatment of whitespace and newlines:** GPT-2 represents newline breaks and multiple whitespace characters as tokens, which is significant for understanding code, while Flan-T5 does not. GPT-4 and StarCoder2, focused on code as well, represent multiple spaces as a single token.
    *   **Handling of subwords:** Examples show how words are split into subword tokens (e.g., "capitalization" into "CAP", "ITAL", "IZATION" by GPT-4, or "apologizing" into "apolog", "izing") using methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece.
    *   **Representation of numbers and special characters:** StarCoder2 assigns each digit its own token, while other tokenizers may represent numbers differently (e.g., "12.0*50=600" is tokenized in various ways). Emojis and characters from other languages are also handled differently, with some tokenizers like Flan-T5 replacing them with an unknown token `<unk>`.
    *   **Use of special tokens:** Examples highlight the inclusion of special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, `[UNK]`, `[PAD]`, `<|endoftext|>`, `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, `<|system|>`, and fill-in-the-middle tokens, and how they are used for different purposes (classification, separation of text, indicating the beginning/end of text, etc.).

*   **Underlying Training Data Influence:** The comparison of tokenizers on the same example text implicitly demonstrates how the **training data** of a tokenizer influences its vocabulary and tokenization behavior. For instance, the GPT-4 and StarCoder2 tokenizers show a focus on code due to their specific handling of whitespace and code-related keywords. Similarly, Galactica's tokenizer includes special tokens for scientific content due to its training on scientific data.

In summary, **examples are fundamental to the discussion of tokenization** in the sources. They provide a tangible way to understand the abstract concepts of how text is broken down into tokens, the different methods employed by various tokenizers, and the impact of design choices and training data on the tokenization process. By examining these examples, readers can gain a practical intuition for the crucial first step in how language models process and understand text.

**BERT Tokenizer** <a id="bert"></a>

The sources extensively use **examples** to illustrate the differences between the cased and uncased BERT tokenizers. These examples are crucial for understanding how these tokenizers handle text compared to others.

Here's a discussion of BERT tokenizers (cased & uncased) in the context of examples:

*   **Introduction of BERT Tokenizers:** The book introduces both the uncased and cased versions of the BERT base model tokenizers by providing links to their Hugging Face model hubs, detailing their tokenization method (WordPiece), vocabulary sizes, and special tokens (`[UNK]`, `[SEP]`, `[PAD]`, `[CLS]`, `[MASK]`).

*   **Illustrating Case Sensitivity:** The primary distinction between the two is highlighted through a direct comparison of their tokenized outputs for the same example text.
    *   **Uncased BERT:** The example shows that the uncased tokenizer first converts all input text to **lowercase**. For instance, "English" becomes "english" and "CAPITALIZATION" becomes "capital ##ization". This example clearly demonstrates that the uncased model loses case information.
    *   **Cased BERT:** In contrast, the example for the cased tokenizer shows that it **preserves the original casing**. "English" remains "English" and "CAPITALIZATION" is tokenized as "CA ##PI ##TA ##L ##I ##Z ##AT ##ION". This example directly illustrates the case-sensitive nature of this tokenizer.

*   **Demonstrating Subword Tokenization:** Both examples of BERT tokenization illustrate the use of **subword tokens** and the `##` prefix.
    *   The uncased example shows "capitalization" being split into "capital" and "##ization".
    *   The cased example further breaks down "CAPITALIZATION" into multiple subtokens, each prefixed with `##` except the first one.
    *   These examples visually demonstrate how WordPiece tokenization splits words into smaller, more frequent units. The `##` indicates that the subtoken is a continuation of the preceding token and doesn't have a preceding space.

*   **Highlighting Handling of Unknown Tokens:** The examples reveal how both tokenizers handle characters not present in their vocabulary. In both the cased and uncased examples, the Chinese characters and the emoji are replaced with the special `[UNK]` token. This demonstrates how these BERT tokenizers deal with **out-of-vocabulary** items.

*   **Illustrating the Use of Special Tokens:** Both examples show the input text being wrapped with the `[CLS]` token at the beginning and the `[SEP]` token at the end. The accompanying text explains the utility of these **special tokens**: `[CLS]` for classification tasks and `[SEP]` as a separator for tasks involving two text sequences.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers:** By presenting these BERT tokenizer examples alongside those of other models (GPT-2, Flan-T5, etc.) on the same input text, the book allows for a direct visual comparison of their tokenization behaviors. This larger context of examples emphasizes the unique characteristics of BERT's WordPiece tokenization, its handling of case, subwords, unknown tokens, and special tokens, compared to the BPE used by GPT models or SentencePiece used by Flan-T5. For instance, the examples show that GPT-2 preserves newlines and represents them as tokens, unlike the BERT tokenizers.

In the larger context of examples, the way the book presents the cased and uncased BERT tokenizers is a prime illustration of how **concrete instances of tokenization are used to convey key concepts and differences** between tokenization methods and models. By examining the tokenized output for the same input, the reader gains a practical understanding of the implications of case sensitivity and subword tokenization, which are fundamental aspects of how language models like BERT process text. The examples make the abstract concepts of tokenization methods tangible and facilitate a deeper understanding of why different tokenizers are suited for different tasks and domains.

**GPT-2** <a id="gpt2"></a>

The sources use **examples** extensively to illustrate the behavior of the GPT-2 tokenizer, allowing for a direct comparison with other tokenization methods. Here's what the sources say about the GPT-2 tokenizer in this larger context:

*   **Introduction of the GPT-2 Tokenizer:** The book introduces the GPT-2 tokenizer by stating its tokenization method is **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**, which was introduced in the paper "Neural machine translation of rare words with subword units". It also specifies its **vocabulary size of 50,257** and its special token: **`<|endoftext|>`**.

*   **Illustrative Example:** A specific example text is used to demonstrate how different tokenizers, including GPT-2, break down text. The tokenized output of GPT-2 for this text is provided:
    ```
    English and CAP ITAL IZ ATION
    ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½
    show _ t ok ens False None el if == >= else : two tabs :" " Three tabs : " "
    12 . 0 * 50 = 600
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** By examining this output, the book highlights several key characteristics of the GPT-2 tokenizer:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Unlike the uncased BERT tokenizer, GPT-2 **preserves the capitalization** of the input text. For instance, "CAPITALIZATION" remains as such, though it's further broken down into subwords.
    *   **Handling of Newline Breaks:** The example clearly shows that **newline breaks are represented as tokens** by the GPT-2 tokenizer. This contrasts with tokenizers like Flan-T5, which do not have specific tokens for newlines.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** The word "CAPITALIZATION" is tokenized into "CAP", "ITAL", "IZATION", demonstrating the use of **subword units** by BPE. Similarly, "tokens" is broken down into "t", "ok", "ens" in the Galactica example.
    *   **Whitespace Handling:** The example shows that **whitespace is treated as significant**. Two tabs are represented as a single token (token number 197 in its vocabulary), and four spaces are represented as three tokens (number 220) with the final space being part of the closing quote token. This is a point of difference with GPT-4 and StarCoder2, which have specific tokens for sequences of whitespaces. The book notes the importance of whitespace representation for models dealing with code.
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji in the example text are represented by **multiple unknown-like tokens (ï¿½)**. This indicates that while it preserves capitalization, it may not have specific representations for all Unicode characters present in the input.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:** The side-by-side comparison of GPT-2's tokenization with that of BERT (cased and uncased), Flan-T5, GPT-4, StarCoder2, and Galactica on the same example text allows readers to understand the trade-offs and design choices of different tokenization methods. For example, the contrast with BERT highlights the difference in case sensitivity and the specific subword tokenization approaches (BPE vs. WordPiece). The comparison with Flan-T5 emphasizes the differing treatment of whitespace and unknown characters.

*   **Use in Other Contexts:** The GPT2Tokenizer is also mentioned in the context of the BLIP-2 model for multimodal tasks, where it's used to process the text input alongside images. An example of tokenizing the sentence "Her vocalization was remarkably melodic" using the BLIP-2's GPT2Tokenizer is provided to illustrate its basic text processing.

In the larger context of **examples**, the sources effectively use the GPT-2 tokenizer's output on a common input text to showcase its specific characteristics, particularly its preservation of case, its handling of whitespace and newlines, and its use of byte pair encoding for subword tokenization. By juxtaposing this with the tokenization results of other models on the same example, the book provides a practical and intuitive understanding of the nuances of different tokenization approaches and their potential impact on language model performance.

**Flan-T5** <a id="flant5"></a>

The sources utilize **examples** to effectively illustrate the characteristics of the Flan-T5 tokenizer and to compare it with other tokenization approaches. Here's a discussion of the Flan-T5 tokenizer in this larger context:

*   **Introduction of the Flan-T5 Tokenizer:** The book introduces the Flan-T5 tokenizer by specifying that it uses an implementation called **SentencePiece**, which supports both Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and the unigram language model. It also mentions its **vocabulary size of 32,100** and its special tokens: **`<unk>`** (unknown token) and **`<pad>`** (padding token).

*   **Illustrative Example:** A common example text is used to demonstrate the tokenization process for various LLMs, including Flan-T5. The tokenized output for Flan-T5 is presented as follows:
    ```
    English and CA PI TAL IZ ATION <unk> <unk> show _ to ken s Fal s e None e l if = = > = else : two tab s : " " Three tab s : " " 12. 0 * 50 = 600 </s>
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** By examining this specific output, several key aspects of the Flan-T5 tokenizer's behavior are highlighted:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Similar to GPT-2 and the cased BERT, Flan-T5 **preserves the capitalization** of the input text, as seen with "English" and "CAPITALIZATION".
    *   **Absence of Newline or Whitespace Tokens:** A significant observation from the example is that Flan-T5 **does not have specific tokens for newline characters or multiple whitespace characters**. This contrasts with GPT-2, which represents newlines as tokens, and GPT-4 and StarCoder2, which have specific tokens for sequences of whitespaces. The book notes that this absence could make it **challenging for the model to work with code**.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** The example shows words like "CAPITALIZATION" being broken down into subword tokens such as "CA", "PI", "TAL", and "IZ", demonstrating the subword tokenization capability of SentencePiece. Similarly, "tokens" becomes "to", "ken", and "s", and "False" is split into "Fal" and "s", while "else" is tokenized as "e", "l", and "if".
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji in the input text are both replaced by the **`<unk>` token**. This indicates that the Flan-T5 tokenizer, in this trained version, lacks specific representations for these characters, making the model "completely blind to them". This differs from GPT-2, which used multiple unknown-like tokens.
    *   **Special `<pad>` and `</s>` Tokens:** While not explicitly present in the tokenized output of this particular example, the book mentions `<pad>` as a special token for padding. The `</s>` token appears at the very end of the tokenized text in the example.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:** The inclusion of Flan-T5's tokenization in the comparative example allows for direct contrasts:
    *   With BERT (uncased), it highlights the difference in case sensitivity.
    *   With GPT-2, it emphasizes the different approaches to handling whitespace and newlines, as well as potentially different subword segmentation strategies.
    *   With GPT-4 and StarCoder2, it underscores the distinct ways code-related elements like whitespace and keywords are treated.
    *   The consistent replacement of non-ASCII characters with `<unk>` distinguishes Flan-T5 from tokenizers that might use other mechanisms.

*   **Tokenization Method (SentencePiece):** The book explicitly mentions that Flan-T5 uses SentencePiece, highlighting this as a distinct tokenization method alongside WordPiece (used by BERT) and BPE (used by GPT models). The example implicitly demonstrates the outcome of SentencePiece's subword segmentation.

In the larger context of **examples**, the way the source presents the Flan-T5 tokenizer's output on a standard input provides a clear and practical understanding of its tokenization choices. By directly comparing it with the output of other tokenizers on the same input, the book effectively illustrates the **impact of the underlying tokenization method (SentencePiece), vocabulary, and handling of different character types (case, whitespace, non-ASCII)** on how text is prepared for language models. These examples make the abstract differences in tokenization strategies tangible and contribute significantly to the reader's comprehension of this crucial preprocessing step.

**GPT-4** <a id="gpt4"></a>

The sources extensively use **examples** to illustrate the behavior of the GPT-4 tokenizer, particularly in comparison to other tokenization methods. Here's a discussion of the GPT-4 tokenizer based on these examples:

*   **Introduction of the GPT-4 Tokenizer:** The book mentions that the GPT-4 tokenizer uses **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** and has a **vocabulary size of a little over 100,000**. It also lists its special tokens, including `<|endoftext|>` and the fill-in-the-middle tokens: `<|fim_prefix|>`, `<|fim_middle|>`, and `<|fim_suffix|>`.

*   **Illustrative Example:** A common example text is used to demonstrate how different tokenizers, including GPT-4, break down text. The tokenized output of GPT-4 for this text is provided as:
    ```
    English and CAPITAL IZATION
    ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½
    show _tokens False None elif == >= else : two tabs :"  " Three tabs : "  "
    12 . 0 * 50 = 600
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** By examining this output, the book highlights several key characteristics of the GPT-4 tokenizer, often in comparison to its ancestor, GPT-2:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Like GPT-2, Flan-T5, and the cased BERT, the GPT-4 tokenizer **preserves capitalization**, as seen in "English" and "CAPITALIZATION".
    *   **Handling of Whitespace:** A significant difference noted is that the **GPT-4 tokenizer represents the four spaces as a single token**. In fact, it has specific tokens for every sequence of whitespaces up to a list of 83 whitespaces. This is a key improvement over GPT-2, which used three tokens for the same four spaces.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** Similar to GPT-2, "CAPITALIZATION" is broken down into subwords, but in GPT-4 it is represented by **two tokens** ("CAPITAL" and "IZATION") compared to GPT-2's four ("CAP", "ITAL", "IZ", "ATION"). This suggests a more efficient subword tokenization. Similarly, "tokens" is represented as a single token in GPT-4, compared to three in GPT-2 ("t", "ok", "ens").
    *   **Handling of Programming Code:** The Python keyword **"elif" has its own token in GPT-4**. This, along with the improved whitespace handling, suggests a greater focus on code in addition to natural language compared to GPT-2.
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji in the example text are represented by **multiple unknown-like tokens (ï¿½)**, similar to GPT-2.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:** The side-by-side comparison of GPT-4's tokenization with other models on the same text allows for several key insights:
    *   **Versus GPT-2:** GPT-4 is presented as behaving **similarly to its ancestor**, but with more efficient tokenization of words like "CAPITALIZATION" and "tokens," and improved handling of whitespace and code-related tokens.
    *   **Versus Flan-T5:** Unlike Flan-T5, GPT-4 **retains some representation for whitespace** (as a single token for multiple spaces) and likely would handle code differently given the specific "elif" token. Flan-T5 replaced the non-ASCII characters with a single `<unk>` token, while GPT-4 uses multiple unknown-like tokens.
    *   **Versus StarCoder2:** Both GPT-4 and StarCoder2 encode lists of whitespaces as a single token, indicating a focus on code. However, StarCoder2 assigns each digit its own token (e.g., "600" becomes "6", "0", "0"), which is different from GPT-4's representation.
    *   **Versus BERT:** Unlike the BERT tokenizers, GPT-4 does not add `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens to the beginning and end of the input in this example, as its primary use case is generative text. BERT also uses WordPiece tokenization, leading to different subword segmentations (e.g., BERT's "CAPITALIZATION" into multiple tokens with `##` prefixes).

In the larger context of **examples**, the sources effectively demonstrate how the GPT-4 tokenizer builds upon the foundations of GPT-2 while incorporating improvements for handling whitespace and code, and achieving more efficient subword tokenization for certain words. The direct comparison with other contemporary tokenizers like Flan-T5 and StarCoder2 highlights the evolving design choices in tokenization based on the intended capabilities and training data of the language model.

**StarCoder2** <a id="starcoder2"></a>

The sources extensively use **examples** to illustrate the characteristics of the StarCoder2 tokenizer, especially by comparing its output to that of other prominent tokenizers. Here's a discussion of the StarCoder2 tokenizer in this larger context:

*   **Introduction of the StarCoder2 Tokenizer:** The book introduces StarCoder2 as a **15-billion parameter model focused on generating code**. It states that its tokenizer uses **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** and has a **vocabulary size of 49,152**. The special tokens mentioned include `<|endoftext|>` and fill-in-the-middle tokens (`<fim_prefix>`, `<fim_middle>`, `<fim_suffix>`, `<fim_pad>`). Additionally, the book highlights that StarCoder2 uses special tokens for code-related context, such as `<filename>`, `<reponame>`, and `<gh_stars>`.

*   **Illustrative Example:** A common example text, which includes English text, capitalization, special characters, Python code snippets with indentation, and numbers, is used to demonstrate the tokenization process across various LLMs, including StarCoder2. The tokenized output for StarCoder2 is presented as:
    ```
    English and CAPITAL IZATION
    ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½
    show _ tokens False None elif == >= else : two tabs :"  " Three tabs : "  "
    1 2 . 0 * 5 0 = 6 0 0
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** By examining this specific output, the book draws attention to several key features of the StarCoder2 tokenizer, often in direct comparison with other tokenizers:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Similar to GPT-2, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and the cased BERT, StarCoder2 **preserves the capitalization** of the input text.
    *   **Handling of Whitespace:** Like GPT-4, StarCoder2 **encodes the list of whitespaces as a single token**. This is highlighted as a similarity arising from the model's focus on code generation, where whitespace and indentation are significant.
    *   **Digit Tokenization:** A **major difference** between StarCoder2 and all other tokenizers discussed so far is that **each digit is assigned its own token** (e.g., "600" becomes "6", "0", "0", and "12.0" becomes "1", "2", ".", "0"). The book explains the hypothesis behind this choice: it aims to lead to a better representation of numbers and mathematics, contrasting it with examples like GPT-2 where "870" is a single token but "871" is two.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** Words like "CAPITALIZATION" are broken down into subwords ("CAPITAL", "IZATION"), similar to GPT-4, suggesting an efficient subword strategy. "tokens" is represented as two tokens ("\_", "tokens"), which differs from GPT-2 (three tokens) and GPT-4 (one token).
    *   **Handling of Programming Code:** The Python keyword **"elif" appears as a single token**, aligning with GPT-4 and indicating a focus on code. The handling of tabs ("two tabs :"  "", "Three tabs :""  "") suggests that tabs are treated similarly to spaces, with sequences potentially having their own tokens.
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji are replaced by **multiple unknown-like tokens (ï¿½)**, consistent with GPT-2 and GPT-4, but different from Flan-T5 which uses a single `<unk>` token.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:** The side-by-side presentation of StarCoder2's tokenization alongside others allows for direct comparisons that underscore its unique characteristics:
    *   **Versus GPT-4:** Both models show an awareness of code by having a single token for multiple whitespaces and the keyword "elif". However, StarCoder2's **digit-by-digit tokenization** stands out as a key differentiator.
    *   **Versus GPT-2:** While both use BPE, they differ in how they segment words and handle whitespace and digits. StarCoder2's whitespace handling is more advanced than GPT-2's.
    *   **Versus BERT:** Unlike BERT's WordPiece, StarCoder2 uses BPE, leading to different subword breakdowns. BERT also adds `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens which are absent in this generative code-focused model's output example.
    *   **Versus Flan-T5:** StarCoder2, like GPT-4 and GPT-2, uses multiple unknown tokens for non-ASCII characters, unlike Flan-T5's single `<unk>`. Flan-T5 also lacks specific whitespace tokens, which both GPT-4 and StarCoder2 have.

In the larger context of **examples**, the sources effectively use the comparative tokenization of a diverse text to highlight StarCoder2's specific design choices tailored for code generation. The **unique digit tokenization** and the efficient handling of whitespace, alongside the presence of code-related special tokens (mentioned but not directly visible in this text example), emphasize its specialization compared to more general-purpose language models like GPT-2 and even GPT-4. These examples provide a tangible understanding of how tokenization strategies are adapted based on the intended domain and capabilities of the language model.

**Galactica** <a id="galactica"></a>

The sources provide a description of the Galactica tokenizer and an example of how it tokenizes a specific text, allowing for comparisons with other tokenizers. Here's a discussion of the Galactica tokenizer in the larger context of these examples:

*   **Introduction of the Galactica Tokenizer:** The book describes Galactica as a model "**focused on scientific knowledge**" and trained on scientific papers, reference materials, and knowledge bases. Its tokenizer uses **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** and has a **vocabulary size of 50,000**. The special tokens listed include `<s>`, `<pad>`, `</s>`, `<unk>`, and specific tokens for citations (`[START_REF]`, `[END_REF]`) and reasoning (`<work>`), as well as mentions of tokens for mathematics, amino acid sequences, and DNA sequences.

*   **Illustrative Example:** The same example text used to evaluate other tokenizers is also processed by the Galactica tokenizer. The resulting tokenization is shown as:
    ```
    English and CAP ITAL IZATION
    ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½
    show _ tokens False None elif == > = else : two t abs : "  " Three t abs : "  "
    1 2 . 0 * 5 0 = 6 0 0
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** Examining this output reveals several characteristics of the Galactica tokenizer, which are then compared to others:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Similar to GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Flan-T5, and the cased BERT, Galactica **preserves capitalization**, as seen in "English" and "CAP".
    *   **Handling of Whitespace:** The Galactica tokenizer behaves similarly to **StarCoder2 and GPT-4** in that it **assigns a single token to sequences of whitespace of different lengths** (e.g., `"  "` becomes a single token). This is consistent with models that might need to understand the structure of code or formatted text.
    *   **Tab Handling:** Galactica is highlighted as being unique among the tokenizers discussed so far in that it **assigns a single token to the string made up of two tabs ('\t\t')**. This suggests a particular sensitivity to whitespace variations, potentially relevant in scientific documents or code. The example shows `"  "` for three tabs, indicating similar handling.
    *   **Digit Tokenization:** Like **StarCoder2**, Galactica assigns **each digit its own token** (e.g., "600" becomes "6", "0", "0", and "12.0" becomes "1", "2", ".", "0"). This reinforces the idea that this tokenization strategy might be beneficial for representing numerical and mathematical information, given Galactica's focus on scientific knowledge.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** "CAPITALIZATION" is broken down into "CAP", "ITAL", and "IZATION", consisting of three tokens. This is different from GPT-2 (four tokens), GPT-4 (two tokens), and StarCoder2 (two tokens), suggesting a different approach to subword segmentation. "tokens" is represented as two tokens ("\_", "tokens"), similar to StarCoder2 but different from GPT-2 (three) and GPT-4 (one).
    *   **Handling of Programming Code:** The Python keyword **"elif" appears as a single token**, similar to GPT-4 and StarCoder2, indicating some level of awareness for code structures, although the model's primary focus is science.
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji are replaced by **multiple unknown-like tokens (ï¿½)**, consistent with GPT-2, GPT-4, and StarCoder2, and different from Flan-T5's single `<unk>` token.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:** The side-by-side comparison highlights Galactica's specific design:
    *   **Versus StarCoder2 and GPT-4:** Galactica shares the efficient handling of whitespace and the digit-by-digit tokenization with StarCoder2, suggesting these might be beneficial for both code and scientific/mathematical content. Its whitespace handling is more granular than GPT-4 as it specifically tokens tabs.
    *   **Versus GPT-2:** While both use BPE, their subword segmentation and whitespace handling differ. Galactica's explicit tokenization of tabs is a key difference.
    *   **Versus BERT:** The absence of `[CLS]` and `[SEP]` tokens and the use of BPE distinguish Galactica from BERT.
    *   **Versus Flan-T5:** Galactica's treatment of non-ASCII characters with multiple unknown tokens and its whitespace handling differ from Flan-T5.

In the larger context of **examples**, the Galactica tokenizer demonstrates design choices that reflect its specialization in scientific knowledge. Its unique handling of tabs and its shared digit tokenization with StarCoder2 suggest a sensitivity to details relevant in scientific documents and potentially code. The subword tokenization strategy falls somewhere between the more aggressive segmentation of GPT-2 and the more compressed forms seen in GPT-4 and StarCoder2. These examples provide a concrete understanding of how tokenizer design can be tailored to the specific domain of a language model.

**Phi-3/Llama2** <a id="phi3"></a>

The sources state that the Phi-3 model reuses the tokenizer of Llama 2 and adds a number of special tokens.

*   **Tokenization Method and Vocabulary Size:** The Phi-3 and Llama 2 tokenizer uses **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** and has a **vocabulary size of 32,000**.

*   **Special Tokens:** The special tokens include `<|endoftext|>` and chat tokens such as `<|user|>`, `<|assistant|>`, and `<|system|>`.

*   **Illustrative Example:** The common example text is tokenized by Phi-3 and Llama 2 as follows:

    ```
    <s>
    English and C AP IT AL IZ ATION ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ show _ to kens False None elif == >= else : two tabs :"  " Three tabs : "  "
    1 2 . 0 * 5 0 = 6 0 0
    ```

*   **Key Observations from the Example:** By examining this output and comparing it to the others, we can note the following:
    *   **Preservation of Capitalization:** Like most of the modern tokenizers (GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, Galactica, and cased BERT), **capitalization is preserved**. "English" is tokenized with the initial capital letter. However, "CAPITALIZATION" is broken down into "C", "AP", "IT", "AL", "IZATION", which is a unique segmentation compared to others.
    *   **Handling of Whitespace:** Phi-3/Llama 2 appears to treat multiple spaces (`"  "`, `"   "`) within the text as they appear, unlike GPT-4, StarCoder2, and Galactica which tokenize them as single tokens. The space before "show" is represented by "\_".
    *   **Digit Tokenization:** Similar to **StarCoder2 and Galactica**, **each digit is assigned its own token** (e.g., "600" becomes "6", "0", "0", and "12.0" becomes "1", "2", ".", "0"). This again suggests a focus on numerical representation, potentially inherited from Llama 2 or deemed important for Phi-3's intended use cases.
    *   **Subword Tokenization:** The tokenization of "CAPITALIZATION" into multiple, smaller tokens demonstrates subword tokenization. The specific segmentation ("C", "AP", "IT", "AL", "IZATION") is distinct from other models like GPT-2 ("CAP", "ITAL", "IZATION"), GPT-4 ("CAPITAL", "IZATION"), StarCoder2 ("CAPITAL", "IZATION"), and Galactica ("CAP", "ITAL", "IZATION"). "tokens" is broken into "\_", "to", "kens", which is different from GPT-2 ("\_", "t", "ok", "ens"), GPT-4 ("\_tokens"), StarCoder2 ("\_", "tokens"), and Galactica ("\_", "tokens").
    *   **Handling of Programming Code:** The Python keyword **"elif" is a single token**, consistent with GPT-4, StarCoder2, and Galactica, indicating some level of code awareness.
    *   **Handling of Non-ASCII Characters:** The Chinese characters and the emoji are replaced by **multiple unknown-like tokens (ï¿½)**, aligning with GPT-2, GPT-4, StarCoder2, and Galactica, and differing from Flan-T5's single `<unk>` token.
    *   **Initial Special Token:** The example starts with the `<s>` token, which is a special beginning-of-sequence token, similar to BERT's `[CLS]` and different from GPT-2 and GPT-4 which use `<|endoftext|>`.

*   **Comparison with Other Tokenizers through Examples:**
    *   **Versus GPT-4, StarCoder2, and Galactica:** While all these models preserve capitalization and tokenize "elif" as a single token, Phi-3/Llama 2 differs in its whitespace handling and the specific subword segmentation of words like "CAPITALIZATION" and "tokens". However, it shares the digit-by-digit tokenization with StarCoder2 and Galactica.
    *   **Versus GPT-2:** Both use BPE and preserve capitalization, but their subword tokenization and handling of whitespace and special tokens (`<s>` vs. `<|endoftext|>`) differ.
    *   **Versus BERT:** Phi-3/Llama 2 uses BPE and includes chat-specific tokens, unlike BERT's WordPiece and classification/separation tokens. The subword segmentation also differs significantly.
    *   **Versus Flan-T5:** Phi-3/Llama 2's handling of non-ASCII characters (multiple unknown tokens) and whitespace differs from Flan-T5 (single `<unk>` and no explicit whitespace tokens).

In the context of the provided examples, the Phi-3/Llama 2 tokenizer demonstrates a BPE-based approach with a specific vocabulary and set of special tokens tailored for general language and conversational use. Its treatment of capitalization is standard, and it shares the digit-by-digit tokenization with models focused on code and scientific content. However, its unique subword segmentation and different whitespace handling distinguish it from the other tokenizers illustrated. The inclusion of the `<s>` token at the beginning of the sequence in the example is also a notable characteristic.
