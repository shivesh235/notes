## Hands On LLM

### Embdeddings <a id="embeddings"></a>

The sources emphasize that **embeddings are fundamental to how Large Language Models (LLMs) understand and process language**. They serve as **numerical representations of text** (at the level of words, subwords/tokens, sentences, or entire documents) that capture their meaning and relationships in a vector space.

Here's a discussion of embeddings in the larger context of LLMs, drawing from the sources:

*   **The Necessity of Embeddings for LLMs:** LLMs operate on numerical data. Tokenizers first break down text into smaller units called tokens. Then, **each token in the tokenizer's vocabulary is associated with a vector called an embedding**. This **embedding vector is the initial numerical input to the LLM**. Without embeddings, LLMs could not process textual input.

*   **Types of Embeddings Discussed:** The sources cover several types of embeddings:
    *   **Word Embeddings:** Models like **word2vec** were early successful attempts at capturing the meaning of individual words in dense vector representations. They learn semantic relationships by analyzing which words appear near each other in large amounts of text. These embeddings are **static**, meaning a word has the same embedding regardless of its context.
    *   **Token Embeddings:** In the context of LLMs, embeddings are often discussed at the **token level**. These are the numerical representations of the individual tokens produced by the tokenizer and are the direct input to the Transformer architecture.
    *   **Contextualized Word Embeddings:** Unlike static word embeddings, **LLMs generate contextualized word embeddings**. This means that the embedding of a word or token varies depending on the surrounding words in the sentence. This ability to encode context is a key advancement enabled by architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and, more effectively, the **Transformer using the attention mechanism**. Representation models like BERT are particularly adept at creating these contextualized embeddings.
    *   **Sentence/Text Embeddings:** Many applications require representing entire sentences, paragraphs, or documents as single vectors. **Text embedding models** are specifically designed to produce these embeddings, often by averaging the token embeddings of the text. Libraries like `sentence-transformers` are used to leverage pretrained models for this purpose.
    *   **Multimodal Embeddings:** The sources also introduce **multimodal embedding models** like CLIP, which can create embeddings for different types of data, such as text and images, in the **same vector space**. This allows for comparing and relating information across modalities.

*   **Creation of Embeddings:**
    *   **Word2vec:** Word embeddings in models like word2vec are learned through training a neural network to predict whether two words are likely to appear in the same context. This process updates the embedding vectors to reflect the relationships between words.
    *   **Within LLMs:** For LLMs, the initial token embeddings are often **randomly initialized**. During the **pretraining process** on massive datasets, the model learns the optimal values for these embeddings to effectively represent the patterns and meanings in the language. For contextualized embeddings, the Transformer architecture, particularly the attention mechanism, plays a crucial role in generating context-aware representations of each token based on its relation to other tokens in the input sequence.

*   **Uses of Embeddings in the Context of LLMs:** Embeddings are leveraged in numerous ways in the field of Language AI:
    *   **Input to LLMs:** As mentioned, token embeddings serve as the primary input for LLMs to process and generate text.
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Embeddings allow for measuring the **semantic similarity** between words, sentences, or documents by calculating the distance between their corresponding vectors in the embedding space. Closer vectors indicate more similar meaning. This is fundamental for tasks like semantic search and clustering.
    *   **Downstream Tasks:** Embeddings are used as features for various downstream NLP tasks:
        *   **Text Classification:** Both task-specific models and general-purpose embedding models can be used for text classification. Embedding the text and then using these embeddings to train a classifier is a common approach.
        *   **Text Clustering and Topic Modeling:** By embedding documents and then applying clustering algorithms to these embeddings, semantically similar documents can be grouped together. Topic modeling techniques like BERTopic leverage embeddings to identify underlying themes in a collection of documents.
        *   **Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Embeddings are central to semantic search, where search queries and documents are embedded, and the most relevant documents are retrieved based on the similarity of their embeddings. In RAG systems, retrieved documents (obtained through embedding similarity) are provided as context to the LLM to help it generate more accurate and factual answers.
        *   **Recommendation Systems:** The concept of embedding is also valuable in domains outside of natural language, such as recommendation systems, where items like songs can be embedded based on user interactions (e.g., playlists) to find similar items.
        *   **Multimodal Applications:** Multimodal embeddings enable tasks like image retrieval based on text queries and vice versa.

*   **Relationship with Tokenizers:** The **tokenizer and the embedding layer of an LLM are tightly coupled**. A pretrained language model is linked with its specific tokenizer, and they cannot be easily interchanged without retraining. The tokenizer determines the vocabulary of tokens, and the embedding layer holds a vector representation for each of these tokens.

*   **Training and Fine-tuning Embedding Models:** The sources discuss methods for creating and improving embedding models. This can involve training from scratch or **fine-tuning pretrained models** on specific tasks or datasets to optimize the quality of the embeddings for those particular use cases. **Contrastive learning**, where the model learns to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs of data, is a key technique used in training embedding models, including word2vec and sentence embedding models. Techniques like **multiple negatives ranking (MNR) loss** are used to train models to differentiate a positive example from multiple negative examples.

In summary, embeddings are a cornerstone of LLM technology, enabling the conversion of human language into a numerical format that these models can process. They capture semantic meaning and relationships at different levels of granularity and are crucial for a wide range of LLM applications, from the fundamental task of language understanding and generation to more complex tasks like semantic search, RAG, and multimodal interaction. The quality and nature of embeddings significantly impact the performance and capabilities of LLMs and the systems built upon them.

### Definition: Vector representations of tokens/text <a id="definition"></a>

The sources define **vector representations of tokens/text** as the core concept of **embeddings**, which are numerical representations of language units that capture their meaning and relationships. In the larger context of embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs), these vector representations are fundamental and permeate various aspects of how language is processed and utilized.

Here's a discussion based on the sources:

*   **Core Definition:** The sources explicitly state that **embeddings are vector representations of data, specifically designed to capture its meaning**. For language, this data can be individual words or subwords (tokens), as well as larger segments of text like sentences or documents. These numerical representations, also called vectors or vector representations, are the way computers can "understand" and process human language.

*   **Token Embeddings as Input to LLMs:** At the most granular level, LLMs work with **token embeddings**. When text is input into an LLM, it is first broken down into tokens by a tokenizer. Then, **each token in the tokenizer's vocabulary is converted into a corresponding vector embedding**. These token embeddings are the initial numerical input that the LLM processes through its network layers.

*   **Semantic Meaning in Vector Space:** A key aspect of these vector representations is their ability to capture **semantic meaning**. Models like word2vec aimed to learn these semantic representations by training on vast amounts of text, such that words appearing in similar contexts would have closer vector representations. This concept extends to LLMs, where the goal is to create embeddings where texts with similar meanings are located closer to each other in a high-dimensional vector space.

*   **Contextualized vs. Static Vector Representations:** While early methods like bag-of-words and word2vec created **static** vector representations (where a word had the same vector regardless of context), LLMs, particularly Transformer-based models, generate **contextualized** vector representations. This means that the vector representation of a token is influenced by the surrounding tokens in the sequence, allowing the model to understand nuances in meaning based on context.

*   **Generating Vector Representations:** The process of generating these vector representations varies depending on the technique:
    *   **Bag-of-words:** Creates vectors based on the frequency of words in a text, forming a sparse representation.
    *   **Word2vec:** Uses neural networks to predict the likelihood of words appearing together, learning dense vector embeddings in the process.
    *   **LLMs:** Initial token embeddings are often random and are refined during the pretraining process on large datasets. The Transformer architecture, with its attention mechanism, is crucial for generating contextualized embeddings. Text embedding models can generate sentence or document embeddings, often by aggregating token embeddings.

*   **Applications Leveraging Vector Representations:** The utility of these vector representations (embeddings) is extensive in the realm of LLMs and Language AI:
    *   **Semantic Search:** By embedding search queries and documents into the same vector space, the similarity between them can be measured, enabling semantic search.
    *   **Text Classification:** Vector representations of text can serve as input features for classification models.
    *   **Text Clustering and Topic Modeling:** Grouping semantically similar documents is achieved by clustering their vector representations.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Vector representations are used to retrieve relevant documents based on a query, which are then used as context for an LLM to generate answers.
    *   **Recommendation Systems:** Items (like songs) can be represented as vectors based on user behavior, allowing for recommendations based on the similarity of these vector representations.
    *   **Multimodal Applications:** Models like CLIP create vector representations of both images and text in a shared space, enabling cross-modal understanding and retrieval.

In essence, **vector representations of tokens and text (embeddings) are the crucial bridge between human language and the numerical world of LLMs**. They enable LLMs to capture meaning, understand context, and perform a wide array of language-related tasks by operating on these numerical representations in a meaningful vector space.

### Types <a id="types"></a>

The sources discuss several **types of embeddings**, which represent different levels of abstraction and serve various purposes within the larger context of Large Language Models (LLMs). These types include word embeddings, token embeddings, contextualized word embeddings, sentence/text embeddings, and multimodal embeddings.

Here's a breakdown of these embedding types in the context of LLMs:

*   **Word Embeddings:** These are **static vector representations of individual words** that aim to capture their semantic meaning. Models like **word2vec** and GloVe learn these embeddings by analyzing the co-occurrence of words in large text corpora. Word embeddings represent the properties of words, and semantically similar words tend to have embeddings that are closer in the vector space. While crucial in the history of Language AI, **static word embeddings have largely been replaced by contextualized embeddings produced by LLMs** for many language processing tasks. However, they are still useful outside of LLMs, such as in recommendation systems.

*   **Token Embeddings:** When text is processed by an LLM, it is first broken down into smaller units called **tokens** by a tokenizer. **Each token in the tokenizer's vocabulary is then mapped to a token embedding**, which is a numerical vector. These **token embeddings serve as the initial input to the language model**. Before training, these vectors are typically initialized randomly. During the training process, the LLM learns to adjust these embeddings to effectively capture the patterns and meaning of the language. A language model holds an embedding vector for each token in its tokenizer's vocabulary.

*   **Contextualized Word Embeddings:** Unlike static word embeddings, LLMs like BERT and those utilizing the Transformer architecture generate **contextualized word embeddings**. This means that the embedding for a specific word **varies depending on the context in which it appears in a sentence**. For example, the word "bank" will have a different embedding when referring to a financial institution versus the bank of a river. This ability to encode context is a key strength of modern LLMs, achieved through mechanisms like the **attention mechanism**. Representation models (encoder-only) like BERT excel at generating these contextualized representations. These embeddings are used for various downstream tasks like named-entity recognition and extractive text summarization.

*   **Sentence/Text Embeddings:** Many applications require representing **entire sentences, paragraphs, or documents as a single vector**. **Text embedding models** are designed to produce these embeddings. One common method to generate text embeddings is by **averaging the token embeddings** of the text. However, high-quality text embedding models are often trained specifically for this task. Libraries like `sentence-transformers` provide access to pretrained models for generating text embeddings, which are crucial for applications like **semantic search, topic modeling, and text classification**.

*   **Multimodal Embeddings:** The sources also introduce the concept of **multimodal embeddings**, which can represent different types of data, such as **text and images, in the same vector space**. Models like **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)** are examples of multimodal embedding models. By embedding text and images into a shared space, it becomes possible to **compare and relate information across these modalities**, enabling tasks like image retrieval based on text queries and zero-shot classification of images using textual descriptions.

In the larger context of LLMs, these different types of embeddings play crucial roles at various stages and for different purposes. Token embeddings are the fundamental building blocks for processing language within LLMs. Contextualized embeddings enhance the model's understanding by considering the surrounding words. Sentence/text embeddings enable LLMs to work with larger chunks of text for tasks like search and document analysis. Finally, multimodal embeddings extend the capabilities of LLMs beyond text to understand and reason about other types of data, broadening their applicability. The development and refinement of these embedding techniques are central to the ongoing advancements in the field of Large Language Models and Language AI.

**Word embeddings (static)** <a id="word-embeddings"></a>

The sources state that **static word embeddings** are **vector representations of individual words that aim to capture their semantic meaning**. Models like **word2vec**, **GloVe**, and fastText are examples of methods that generate these types of embeddings. These models learn the embeddings by training on large amounts of textual data, like Wikipedia, by looking at which other words tend to appear next to each other in a given sentence. The idea is that words that are used in similar contexts will have vector representations that are closer to one another in the embedding space, thus capturing a degree of semantic similarity.

Here are some key aspects of static word embeddings in the larger context of embedding types:

*   **Semantic Meaning:** Static word embeddings attempt to **capture the meaning of words by representing their properties** in a vector. For instance, the embedding for "baby" might be closer to "newborn" and "human" than to "apple". This allows for measuring the semantic similarity between words using distance metrics.

*   **Training Process:** Models like word2vec use neural networks to generate these embeddings. They are trained on tasks like predicting whether two words are likely to be neighbors in a sentence. During this training, the embeddings are updated to reflect the relationships between words.

*   **Static Nature:** A key characteristic of these word embeddings is that they are **static**. This means that **a word has the same embedding regardless of the context in which it is used**. For example, the word "bank" will have the same embedding whether it refers to a financial institution or the bank of a river. This is a significant limitation compared to the contextualized embeddings generated by LLMs.

*   **Historical Significance:** Word embeddings like word2vec were **one of the first successful attempts at capturing the meaning of text in embeddings**. They represented a significant improvement over earlier methods like bag-of-words, which treated language as a literal collection of words and ignored the semantic nature of text.

*   **Current Relevance:** While **largely replaced by contextualized word embeddings produced by language models for many language processing tasks**, static word embeddings still have relevance. The sources mention their usefulness **outside of NLP**, for example, in **recommendation systems**. By treating items like songs as words and user interactions (like playlists) as sentences, similar embedding techniques can be used to recommend related items.

*   **Contrast with Contextualized Embeddings:** The development of LLMs brought about **contextualized word embeddings**, where the representation of a word changes based on the surrounding words in a sentence. This overcomes the limitation of static embeddings by allowing the model to understand different meanings of a word depending on its context. Representation models like BERT are specifically designed to generate these contextualized embeddings.

In summary, static word embeddings like those generated by word2vec and GloVe were a crucial step in the history of embedding techniques, enabling a basic form of semantic understanding in computers. However, their inability to capture context-dependent meaning led to the development of contextualized embeddings in LLMs. Despite this, static word embeddings remain relevant in specific applications outside the core processing of LLMs.

**Contextualized word embeddings** <a id="contextualized-word-embeddings"></a>


The sources highlight **contextualized word embeddings** as a significant advancement over static word embeddings in capturing the nuances of language. Here's a discussion of contextualized word embeddings within the larger context of embedding types, drawing from the sources:

*   **Definition and Generation:** **Contextualized word embeddings are dynamic vector representations of words where the embedding for a word changes based on the context in which it appears in a sentence**. Unlike static word embeddings, which assign a single, fixed vector to each word, contextualized embeddings are generated by language models (LLMs) by considering the surrounding words. Models utilizing the **Transformer architecture**, such as **BERT** and the GPT family, are capable of producing these contextualized representations.

*   **The Role of Attention:** The ability to generate contextualized embeddings is largely attributed to mechanisms like the **attention mechanism**. Attention allows the model to focus on the parts of the input sequence that are most relevant to a particular word, thus incorporating context into its representation. This enables the model to understand that a word like "bank" can have different meanings (financial institution vs. riverbank) depending on the other words in the sentence.

*   **Advantages Over Static Word Embeddings:** The primary advantage of contextualized word embeddings is their ability to capture the **meaning of a word as it is used in a specific instance**. Static word embeddings, like those from word2vec, assign the same embedding to a word regardless of its context, which can lead to ambiguity in understanding. Contextualized embeddings provide a richer and more accurate representation of word meaning by taking the surrounding text into account.

*   **Relationship to Token Embeddings:** The process of generating contextualized word embeddings typically starts with **token embeddings**. When a sentence is input into an LLM, it is first broken down into tokens, and each token is associated with an initial token embedding. These token embeddings then flow through the layers of the language model, where the attention mechanism and other computations are applied to generate the final contextualized word embeddings. Therefore, token embeddings serve as the foundation upon which contextualized word embeddings are built.

*   **Use Cases and Applications:** Contextualized word embeddings are crucial for a wide range of downstream tasks. The sources specifically mention applications such as **named-entity recognition (NER)** and **extractive text summarization**, where understanding the context of words is essential. Furthermore, these contextualized vectors are even used in systems like **AI image generation** (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion), highlighting their versatility in representing meaning across different modalities.

*   **Contrast with Sentence/Text Embeddings:** While contextualized word embeddings represent individual words within a context, **sentence/text embeddings aim to represent larger units of text** (sentences, paragraphs, or documents) as a single vector. Often, sentence embeddings can be derived from contextualized word embeddings (e.g., by averaging them). However, models can also be specifically trained to generate high-quality sentence or text embeddings for tasks like semantic search and topic modeling.

*   **Evolution of Embedding Techniques:** Contextualized word embeddings represent a significant step in the evolution of embedding techniques. They addressed the limitations of earlier static word embeddings and paved the way for more sophisticated language understanding and generation capabilities in LLMs. The success of models like BERT, which heavily rely on contextualized representations, has solidified their importance in modern NLP. Representation models (encoder-only) primarily focus on generating these rich contextualized embeddings.

In essence, contextualized word embeddings are a key innovation in the field of Language AI, enabling LLMs to understand and process language with a much greater degree of sensitivity to context than earlier static methods. They build upon the concept of token embeddings and serve as a crucial intermediate representation that powers a wide array of language understanding tasks, bridging the gap between individual words and the meaning of larger text units.

**Sentence Embeddings** <a id="sentence-embeddings"></a>

The sources describe **sentence embeddings** as **vector representations that capture the meaning of entire sentences, paragraphs, or even documents as a single vector**. This contrasts with word embeddings, which represent individual words, and token embeddings, which represent the smaller units that text is broken down into for processing by language models.

Here's a discussion of sentence embeddings within the larger context of embedding types, drawing from the provided text:

*   **Purpose and Level of Abstraction:** While token embeddings are fundamental to how LLMs process text, and contextualized word embeddings capture word meaning within a sentence, **sentence embeddings operate at a higher level of abstraction**. Their primary goal is to **represent the overall semantic content of a longer piece of text** in a concise numerical vector. This allows for comparisons and operations on entire sentences or documents.

*   **Generation Methods:** The sources outline several ways to produce sentence embeddings:
    *   One common approach is to **average the values of all the token embeddings produced by a language model for the sentence**.
    *   However, the sources emphasize that **high-quality sentence embedding models are often trained specifically for the task of generating these embeddings**.
    *   The **sentence-transformers library** is presented as a popular tool for leveraging **pretrained embedding models** that are optimized for generating sentence embeddings.

*   **Relationship to Word and Token Embeddings:** Sentence embeddings can be seen as building upon the foundation of word or token embeddings. While a language model first processes text into tokens and generates token embeddings (which can become contextualized word embeddings), sentence embedding models take this a step further to produce a single vector for a larger span of text. In some cases, sentence embeddings are derived from the underlying word embeddings, but dedicated models are designed to directly encode the meaning of sequences.

*   **Applications:** The sources highlight the **immense usefulness of sentence embeddings in powering various Language AI applications**. Key examples include:
    *   **Semantic Search:** By embedding search queries and documents into the same vector space, semantic similarity can be measured, allowing for the retrieval of relevant information based on meaning rather than just keyword matches. This is a core component of dense retrieval systems.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Sentence embeddings can be used as features for clustering algorithms to group semantically similar documents, thereby uncovering underlying topics in a collection of texts. Tools like BERTopic leverage embedding models as a crucial first step in their pipeline.
    *   **Classification:** While the chapter on text classification also discusses task-specific models and generative models, it notes that **embedding models can be used to generate multipurpose embeddings which can then serve as input features for a classifier**.
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Sentence embeddings are fundamental to the retrieval component of RAG systems, where relevant documents (represented by their embeddings) are fetched based on the embedding of the user's query.

*   **Contrast with Other Embedding Types:**
    *   **Static Word Embeddings:** Sentence embeddings overcome a key limitation of static word embeddings, which cannot capture the meaning of a word in context, let alone the meaning of an entire sentence. Sentence embeddings aim to capture the holistic meaning of a sequence of words.
    *   **Contextualized Word Embeddings:** While contextualized word embeddings provide rich representations of individual words considering their surroundings, sentence embeddings aggregate this information (or are trained directly) to provide a single representation for the entire sentence. This is necessary for tasks that require comparing or operating on whole units of text.

*   **Training Sentence Embedding Models:** Chapter 10 delves into creating text embedding models and discusses techniques like **contrastive learning** used to train models to understand semantic similarity between sentences. Frameworks like **sentence-transformers (SBERT)** are specifically designed for training and using models that produce high-quality sentence embeddings. Fine-tuning existing language models using labeled data (e.g., natural language inference datasets) or unsupervised methods can improve the quality of the generated sentence embeddings for specific tasks or domains.

In summary, sentence embeddings are a crucial type of embedding that represents the meaning of entire text units. They build upon the concepts of token and word embeddings but operate at a higher level, enabling a wide range of applications that require understanding the semantic relationships between sentences and documents. Dedicated models and libraries like sentence-transformers have made it easier to generate and utilize these powerful representations.
